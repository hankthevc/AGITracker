# Deploy to GitHub Instructions

## Push to https://github.com/hankthevc/AGITracker

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)

```bash
cd "/Users/HenryAppel/AI Doomsday Tracker"

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AGI Signpost Tracker - Full implementation"
```

### Step 2: Connect to GitHub Repository

```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/hankthevc/AGITracker.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to:
1. Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of password
2. Or configure SSH keys

**Generate PAT:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Select: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
- Use the token as your password when pushing

### Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# macOS: brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Push to repository
gh repo sync
```

## After Pushing to GitHub

Your repository will include:
- Complete monorepo structure
- All source code (Frontend + Backend)
- Docker configurations
- Documentation (README, QUICKSTART, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Test suites

The GitHub Actions CI pipeline will automatically:
- Run linters (ESLint, Ruff)
- Execute type checks (TypeScript, mypy)
- Run unit tests (pytest, Jest)
- Report any issues

Check the **Actions** tab on GitHub after pushing to see the CI pipeline status.
