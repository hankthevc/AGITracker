  - Epoch AI, Epoch Supply/Demand, Ajeya Bioanchors, MIRI Soares
- ✅ Populates `expert_predictions` table
- ✅ Links predictions to signposts
- ✅ Forecast comparison logic in `services/etl/app/services/forecast_comparison.py`

**Schema**:
```python
ExpertPrediction:
  - signpost_id
  - source (e.g., "Aschenbrenner", "Metaculus")
  - predicted_date
  - predicted_value
  - confidence_lower / confidence_upper
  - rationale
```

**Location**: `services/etl/app/tasks/predictions/seed_expert_predictions.py` (204 lines)

---

### 6. Golden Set Testing ✅
**Goal**: Validate mapper accuracy against known-good examples

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created `test_mapper_accuracy.py` with pytest integration
- ✅ Loads golden set from `infra/seeds/news_goldset.json` (12 examples)
- ✅ Calculates precision, recall, F1 score

- ✅ Tests confidence calibration (high-confidence predictions should be more accurate)
- ✅ Runnable via `pytest` or standalone

**Test Metrics**:
```python
def calculate_metrics(true_positives, false_positives, false_negatives):
    precision = tp / (tp + fp)
    recall = tp / (tp + fn)
    f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run tests
cd services/etl
pytest tests/test_mapper_accuracy.py -v

# Or run standalone
python tests/test_mapper_accuracy.py
```

**Location**: `services/etl/tests/test_mapper_accuracy.py` (250 lines, newly created)

### 7. Timeline Visualization ✅
**Goal**: Show events on an interactive timeline

**Completed**:

  - **Cumulative count**: Event count and average significance over time
- ✅ Uses Recharts for visualization
- ✅ Color-coded by tier (A=green, B=blue, C=yellow)
- ✅ Filters by tier and date range
- ✅ Stats cards: Total events, avg significance, high-significance count, tier breakdown
- ✅ Responsive with dark mode support

**Visualizations**:
```typescript
ScatterChart: X=date, Y=significance_score, Color=tier
LineChart: X=date, Y_left=event_count, Y_right=avg_significance
```

**Location**: `apps/web/app/timeline/page.tsx` (354 lines)

  - `max_overflow=20`
  - `pool_pre_ping=True` (auto-reconnect)
- ✅ 23 existing indexes in models (verified via grep)
- ✅ Created performance indexes migration: `infra/migrations/versions/add_performance_indexes.py`

**New Indexes**:
```sql
-- Events table
idx_events_needs_review (needs_review, published_at) WHERE needs_review = true
idx_events_provisional (provisional, evidence_tier)
idx_events_source_type (source_type, evidence_tier, published_at)

-- EventSignpostLink table

## 🎓 What I Learned

### Already Existed (Pleasant Surprises)
- Frontend was 100% complete with beautiful UI
- Event analysis LLM task was fully implemented
- Timeline visualization was done
- Monitoring (Sentry, structlog) was integrated
- Database had 23 existing indexes
- Connection pooling was configured

### What I Added
- Enhanced expert predictions to load from JSON files
- Created golden set testing suite with F1 metrics
- Added 11 strategic database indexes for performance
- Created comprehensive monitoring documentation

### What I Skipped (Good Reasons)
- Weekly digest email: Not critical for v1 launch

- Social media ingestion: Too noisy for v1
- Advanced monitoring: Railway + Sentry are sufficient
