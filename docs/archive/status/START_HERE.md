## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### The One Thing Blocking Us

Railway has two API services:
1. **Old service** - Has your data but old code (pre-Sprint 7)
2. **New service** - Has new code but empty database

The old service is connected to production, so we just need to update it with the new code.

### How to Fix (10 minutes)

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find service: `agi-tracker-api-production`
3. Click "Deployments" → "Deploy"
4. Select "From GitHub: main"
5. Wait 3-5 minutes

**That's it!** The service will pull the latest Sprint 7 code.

**Detailed guide**: See `SPRINT_7_ACTION_PLAN.md`

---

## 🧪 How to Test After Deployment

Run this command:
```bash
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests
```

**Before fix**: `{"detail":"Not Found"}`  
**After fix**: `{"digests":[],"count":0}` ✅

If you see the second response, Sprint 7 is fully deployed!
