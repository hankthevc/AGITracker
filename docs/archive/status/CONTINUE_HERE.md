## ⚠️ What's Blocked

**Railway Backend Deployment**

The Sprint 7 code exists in two places:
- ✅ GitHub `main` branch - Latest code
- ✅ New Railway service (`api-production-8535`) - Has code but empty database
- ❌ Old Railway service (`agi-tracker-api-production`) - Has data but old code

**The Problem**: The production domain points to the old service with old code.

**The Solution**: Redeploy the old service to pull latest code from GitHub.

---

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)

Redeploy the old Railway service with new code:

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find service `agi-tracker-api-production`
3. Click "Deployments" → "Deploy" → Select "GitHub: main"
4. Wait 3-5 minutes
5. Test: `curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests`
   - Should return: `{"digests":[],"count":0}`

**Time**: 10 minutes  
**Risk**: Low (just pulls latest code, keeps existing database)  
**See**: `SPRINT_7_ACTION_PLAN.md` for detailed steps

### Option 2: Update Frontend to Use New API

Update Vercel to point to the working service:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` = `https://api-production-8535.up.railway.app`
4. Redeploy frontend

**Issue**: New service has empty database (no events)  
**Fix Needed**: Either seed the database OR configure to use same DB as old service

---

## 🧪 How to Verify When Fixed

After deployment, run these tests:

```bash
# 1. Test new Sprint 7 endpoints
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests
# Expected: {"digests":[],"count":0}

curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/events/1/consensus
# Expected: 200 or 404 (depends if event exists)

# 2. Test old endpoints still work
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/events | jq '.total'
# Expected: Number > 0

# 3. Open API docs
open https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/docs
# Should see new "digests" tag with 2 endpoints

# 4. Test frontend
open https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/digests
# Should load without errors
```

## 📊 Current Service Status

### Service 1: `api-production-8535.up.railway.app` (NEW)
```bash
✅ Health: OK
✅ Has Sprint 7 code
✅ Signposts: 34 loaded
❌ Events: 0 (empty database)
❌ Not on production domain
```

Test results:
```bash
$ curl https://api-production-8535.up.railway.app/v1/digests
{"digests":[],"count":0}  # ✅ Works!

$ curl https://api-production-8535.up.railway.app/v1/events
{"total":0,...}  # ❌ No events
```

### Service 2: `agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app` (OLD)
```bash
✅ Has production domain
✅ Has full database (events + signposts)
❌ Has old code (pre-Sprint 7)
❌ Missing new endpoints
```

Test results:
```bash
$ curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests
{"detail":"Not Found"}  # ❌ 404 - endpoint doesn't exist

# Events endpoint likely works but needs old code updated
```

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Code**: ✅ Complete  
**Deployment**: ⚠️ Needs 10 minutes of manual work  
**Blocker**: Human needs to click "Redeploy" in Railway dashboard

**Next Steps**:
1. Redeploy old Railway service (see `SPRINT_7_ACTION_PLAN.md`)
2. Test endpoints (see commands above)
3. Start Sprint 8 or test Sprint 7 features

## 💬 Questions?

**Q: Can I just use the new service?**  
A: Yes, but you'd need to either seed its database or point it to the same database as the old service.

**Q: Why are there two services?**  
A: Railway created a new service when auto-deploying, but the old one is still running with the production domain.

**Q: What if I don't have Railway access?**  
A: You'll need to either get access or ask someone with Railway admin to redeploy the service.

**Q: Is any code missing?**  
A: No! All Sprint 7 code is complete and in the `main` branch. Just needs to be deployed.
