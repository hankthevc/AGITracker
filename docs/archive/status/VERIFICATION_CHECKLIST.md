# üîç Railway Deployment Verification Checklist

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Purpose**: Verify Phase 2 Railway deployment is working correctly

---

## Pre-Verification: What You Should Have

Before we verify, confirm you have:

- [ ] Pushed the latest commit (`4b9610f` or later) to GitHub
- [ ] Railway project with 3-4 services deployed
- [ ] ADMIN_API_KEY saved somewhere secure (you'll need it for testing)

---

## Step 1: Verify Services Are Running

### 1.1 Check Railway Dashboard

Go to https://railway.app and navigate to your AGI Tracker project.

**You should see these services**:

- [ ] **Redis** - Status: Active (green)
- [ ] **agi-tracker-api** - Status: Active (green)
- [ ] **agi-tracker-celery-worker** - Status: Active (green)
- [ ] **agi-tracker-celery-beat** - Status: Active (green)

**How to check**: Each service should show a green dot and "Active" status. If any show red or "Crashed", click into them to see error logs.

---

## Step 2: Verify API Service Build & Deployment

### 2.1 Check API Build Logs

Click on **agi-tracker-api** service ‚Üí **Deployments** tab ‚Üí Latest deployment.

**Look for these success messages**:
```
‚úì Using Detected Dockerfile
‚úì Build complete
‚úì Deployment successful
```

**Should NOT see**:
```
‚ùå "/services/etl": not found
‚ùå ERROR: failed to build
```

- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] No "not found" errors

### 2.2 Check API Runtime Logs

Click on **agi-tracker-api** service ‚Üí **Logs** tab (or **View Logs** button).

**Look for these startup messages**:
```
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:XXXX
```

- [ ] See "Application startup complete" message
- [ ] No errors about missing environment variables
- [ ] No database connection errors

### 2.3 Test API Health Endpoint

In your terminal, run:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway URL
curl https://YOUR-API-URL.up.railway.app/health
```

**Expected response**:
```json
{"status": "healthy"}
```

- [ ] Health endpoint returns `{"status": "healthy"}`

### 2.4 Test API Events Endpoint

```bash
curl https://YOUR-API-URL.up.railway.app/v1/events | jq
```

**Expected**: Should return JSON array of events (may be empty if no data yet)

- [ ] Events endpoint returns valid JSON (not 500 error)

---

## Step 3: Verify Celery Worker

### 3.1 Check Worker Logs

Click on **agi-tracker-celery-worker** service ‚Üí **Logs** tab.

**Look for this key message**:
```
[timestamp] INFO/MainProcess] celery@HOSTNAME ready.
```

**Also look for**:
```
[config]
- transport:   redis://...
- results:     redis://...
```

- [ ] See "celery@hostname ready" message
- [ ] Worker connected to Redis successfully
- [ ] No connection errors or crashes

### 3.2 Verify Worker Can Connect to Database

In the worker logs, you should see:
```
INFO Successfully connected to database
```

Or at minimum, no errors about database connection failures.

- [ ] No database connection errors in worker logs

---

## Step 4: Verify Celery Beat (Scheduler)

### 4.1 Check Beat Logs

Click on **agi-tracker-celery-beat** service ‚Üí **Logs** tab.

**Look for these messages**:
```
[timestamp] INFO/Beat] beat: Starting...
[timestamp] INFO/Beat] Scheduler: Sending due task ...
```

**Expected scheduled tasks** (you should see these being scheduled):
```
Scheduler: Sending due task fetch-feeds-daily
Scheduler: Sending due task ingest-company-blogs-morning
Scheduler: Sending due task ingest-arxiv-morning
Scheduler: Sending due task map-events-morning
Scheduler: Sending due task generate-event-analysis-morning
Scheduler: Sending due task snapshot-source-credibility
```

- [ ] See "beat: Starting..." message
- [ ] See "Scheduler: Sending due task" messages
- [ ] Beat is scheduling tasks (even if not time to run yet)

---

## Step 5: Verify Redis Connection

### 5.1 Test Redis from API Service

In your local terminal (with Railway CLI installed):

```bash
railway link  # Link to your project if not already linked
railway run -s agi-tracker-api python -c "import redis; r=redis.from_url('$REDIS_URL'); print('‚úÖ Redis ping:', r.ping())"
```

**Expected output**:
```
‚úÖ Redis ping: True
```

- [ ] Redis connection test passes

---

## Step 6: Verify Task Health Endpoint

### 6.1 Test Task Health API

This tests the monitoring dashboard we built in Sprint 4.2.

```bash
# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual ADMIN_API_KEY
# Replace YOUR-API-URL with your Railway API URL

curl https://YOUR-API-URL.up.railway.app/v1/admin/tasks/health \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" | jq
```

**Expected response structure**:
```json
{
  "overall_status": "PENDING",
  "summary": {
    "ok": 0,
    "degraded": 0,
    "error": 0,
    "pending": 15,
    "unknown": 0
  },
  "tasks": {
    "fetch_swebench": {
      "status": "PENDING",
      "last_run": null,
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

- [ ] Task health endpoint returns 200 (not 403 or 500)
- [ ] Returns JSON with overall_status and tasks
- [ ] Tasks show "PENDING" status (they haven't run yet)

**Note**: Tasks will show "PENDING" initially because they haven't run yet. After the scheduled times, they should change to "OK" or "ERROR".

---

## Step 7: Verify Environment Variables

### 7.1 Check Required Variables Are Set

For each service (API, Worker, Beat), verify these environment variables are set:

**In Railway Dashboard** ‚Üí Service ‚Üí **Variables** tab:

**Required on all 3 services**:
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - Should start with `postgresql://` or `postgres://`
- [ ] `REDIS_URL` - Should start with `redis://`
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Should start with `sk-`
- [ ] `ADMIN_API_KEY` - Should be a long random string

**Recommended on all 3 services**:
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] `LOG_LEVEL=info`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGINS=https://agi-tracker.vercel.app`

**Auto-provided by Railway (should exist)**:
- [ ] `PORT` (on API service only)
- [ ] `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`
- [ ] `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`

---

## Step 8: Verify Custom Start Commands

### 8.1 Check Worker Start Command

**agi-tracker-celery-worker** service ‚Üí **Settings** tab ‚Üí **Deploy** section:

**Start Command should be**:
```
celery -A app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

- [ ] Worker start command is correct

### 8.2 Check Beat Start Command

**agi-tracker-celery-beat** service ‚Üí **Settings** tab ‚Üí **Deploy** section:

**Start Command should be**:
```
celery -A app.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
```

- [ ] Beat start command is correct

---

## Step 9: Test New Features (Sprint 4-6)

### 9.1 Test Task Monitoring Dashboard

Open in your browser:
```
https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/admin/tasks
```

**Expected**:
- Page loads without errors
- Shows "Task Monitoring" title
- Asks for API key (use localStorage to set it - see instructions on page)
- After setting API key, shows task status cards

- [ ] Task monitoring dashboard loads
- [ ] Can authenticate with ADMIN_API_KEY
- [ ] Shows task statuses

### 9.2 Test Surprise Score Dashboard

Open in your browser:
```
https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/insights/surprises
```

**Expected**:
- Page loads without errors
- Shows "Prediction Surprises" title
- May show "No surprising events found" if no data yet
- Or shows surprise cards with predicted vs actual dates

- [ ] Surprise dashboard loads
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console

### 9.3 Test Source Credibility Dashboard

Open in your browser:
```
https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/admin/sources
```

**Expected**:
- Page loads without errors
- Shows "Source Credibility" title
- May show "No source credibility data available yet" initially
- After first daily snapshot runs, will show publisher credibility scores

- [ ] Source credibility dashboard loads
- [ ] No errors displayed

---

## Step 10: Verify Scheduled Tasks Will Run

### 10.1 Check Next Scheduled Run Times

The tasks are scheduled at these times (UTC):

**Morning ingestion wave**:
- 5:15 AM - Company blogs
- 5:35 AM - arXiv papers
- 5:55 AM - Social media (opt-in)
- 6:15 AM - Press releases
- 6:30 AM - Event mapping
- 7:00 AM - Event analysis

**Daily tasks**:
- 6:03 AM - Fetch feeds
- 9:00 AM - Source credibility snapshot

**Weekly tasks**:
- Sunday 8:08 AM - Weekly digest
- Monday 8:17 AM - Seed inputs
- Monday 8:32 AM - Security maturity

**To verify tasks will run**:
1. Note the current UTC time
2. Wait for the next scheduled task time
3. Check worker logs for task execution
4. Check beat logs for "Scheduler: Sending due task" message

- [ ] Understand when next task should run
- [ ] Plan to check logs at that time

## Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ùå API service crashes on startup

**Check**:
1. DATABASE_URL is correct and accessible
2. All required environment variables are set
3. Logs for specific error messages

**Solution**: Update environment variables and redeploy

### ‚ùå Worker/Beat can't connect to Redis

**Check**:
1. Redis service is running (green in Railway dashboard)
2. REDIS_URL is set on worker/beat services
3. REDIS_URL format is correct (starts with `redis://`)

**Solution**: Copy REDIS_URL from Redis service to worker/beat services

### ‚ùå Tasks show as PENDING forever

**Reason**: Tasks haven't run yet (scheduled for specific times)

**Solution**: Wait for scheduled time, or manually trigger a task to test

### ‚ùå Task health endpoint returns 403 Forbidden

**Check**: ADMIN_API_KEY is correct in your curl command

**Solution**: Get the correct key from Railway environment variables

### ‚ùå Frontend dashboards show errors

**Check**:
1. API is running and accessible
2. CORS_ORIGINS includes vercel.app domain
3. Browser console for specific errors

**Solution**: Update CORS_ORIGINS and redeploy API
