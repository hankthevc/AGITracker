## 🔥 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Pace Analysis Cards

**Most innovative feature!** Each signpost detail page shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 Aschenbrenner's Situational Awareness│
│ Target: December 31, 2025               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ↗ 26 days ahead of schedule             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ We are approximately 2-3 months ahead   │
│ of Aschenbrenner's projected pace.      │
│ His timeline assumed gradual unhobbling │
│ gains plus steady compute scaling...    │
│ [Full 200-word analysis]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Color coding:**
- 🟢 Green = Ahead of schedule
- 🔴 Red = Behind schedule

- Aschenbrenner (Situational Awareness)
- AI 2027
- Cotra (Biological Anchors)

### 2. Educational Content

**Why It Matters:** 300+ word explanation connecting the metric to AGI significance

**Example for SWE-bench:**

**Current State:** Detailed SOTA analysis with:
- Latest achievements (e.g., "Claude 4.5 Sonnet leads at 70.6%")
- Key breakthroughs enabling progress
- Current limitations and bottlenecks

### 3. Research Links

**Key Papers section:**
- Clickable links to arxiv/research papers
- Publication dates
- 2-3 sentence summaries

**Key Announcements section:**
- Model launches and breakthroughs
- Links to official announcements
- Context about significance

### 4. Technical Deep Dive

**300-500 word explanation of:**
- How the benchmark works
- What it measures
- Evaluation protocol
- What's included/excluded
