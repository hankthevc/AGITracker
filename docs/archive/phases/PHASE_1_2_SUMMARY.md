- 8 medium confidence (0.5-0.7) - 10%
- 0 low confidence (<0.5)
- Average confidence: 0.792

### 2.2 Review Queue API

**Location**: `services/etl/app/main.py` (lines 2318-2494)

**Endpoints**:

1. **GET `/v1/review-queue/mappings`**
   - Query params: `needs_review_only`, `min_confidence`, `max_confidence`, `limit`, `offset`
   - Returns: Paginated list of mappings with full event/signpost context
   - Sorted by: Confidence (lowest first), then created_at (newest first)

2. **POST `/v1/review-queue/mappings/{mapping_id}/approve`**
   - Auth: Requires `x-api-key` header
   - Action: Sets `needs_review=false`, `review_status='approved'`, `reviewed_at=NOW()`
   - Returns: Confirmation with timestamp

3. **POST `/v1/review-queue/mappings/{mapping_id}/reject`**
   - Auth: Requires `x-api-key` header
   - Query params: `reason` (optional rejection reason)
   - Action: Sets `needs_review=false`, `review_status='rejected'`, records reason
   - Returns: Confirmation with timestamp and reason

4. **GET `/v1/review-queue/stats`**
   - Returns: Dashboard statistics
     - Total mappings
     - Needs review count
     - Approved/rejected counts
     - Confidence distribution (low/med/high)
     - Review rate percentage

**Sample Response** (stats):
```json
{
  "total_mappings": 79,
  "needs_review": 6,
  "approved": 1,
  "rejected": 1,
  "pending_review": 77,
  "confidence_distribution": {
    "low": 0,
    "medium": 6,
    "high": 73
  },
  "review_rate": 2.53
}
```

### 2.3 Review Queue UI

**Location**: `apps/web/app/review-queue/page.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Dashboard**:
  - 4 stat cards (Needs Review, Review Rate, Confidence Dist., Total)
  - Progress bars for visual tracking
  - Real-time updates after actions
- **Filters**:
  - Confidence level (All/Low/Med/High)
- **Mapping Cards**:
  - Event details (title, summary, tier)
  - Signpost details (name, code)
  - Confidence badge with color coding
  - Link type badge (supports/contradicts/related)
  - AI-generated rationale display
  - Impact estimate visualization
- **Actions**:
  - Approve button (green, with checkmark icon)
  - Reject button (red, with X icon, prompts for reason)
  - View event link (external link to /events page)
  - Loading states during API calls
- **Security**:

  - Warning banner if no API key provided
  - Protected actions require authentication

**UX Features**:
- Empty state with celebration icon when queue is clear
- Loading spinner during data fetch
- Action feedback (buttons disable during processing)
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

### 2.4 Feedback Loop & Accuracy Tracking

**Database Schema**:
```sql
event_signpost_links:
  - needs_review: boolean (auto-flagged if confidence < 0.7)
  - reviewed_at: timestamptz (NULL until reviewed)
  - review_status: enum ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'flagged')
  - rejection_reason: text (optional explanation)
```

**Feedback Mechanism**:
1. LLM generates mapping with confidence score
2. System auto-flags if confidence < 0.7
3. Human reviewer approves/rejects via UI
4. System tracks approval rate by confidence level
5. Future: Use approval/rejection patterns to fine-tune LLM prompts

**Accuracy Metrics** (current):
- Review rate: 2.53% (2/79 reviewed so far)
- Approval rate: 50% (1 approved, 1 rejected)
- Auto-flagging threshold: 0.7 (captures 10% of mappings)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Review Queue Test (October 22, 2025)

**Test Scenario**: Flagged 8 medium-confidence mappings (0.5-0.7) for review

**Actions Performed**:
1. âœ… Fetched review queue stats
2. âœ… Retrieved mappings sorted by confidence (lowest first)
3. âœ… Approved mapping #1 (Event 4 â†’ Signpost 20, conf=0.60)
4. âœ… Rejected mapping #2 (Event 17 â†’ Signpost 1, conf=0.65, reason: "Confidence too low for this tier")
5. âœ… Verified stats updated correctly (needs_review: 8â†’6, review_rate: 0%â†’2.53%)

**Test Results**:
- âœ“ Stats endpoint calculates correctly
- âœ“ Mappings fetched with proper sorting
- âœ“ Approve workflow sets flags and timestamp
- âœ“ Reject workflow records reason
- âœ“ Review rate calculation accurate
- âœ“ Database transactions committed successfully

## ðŸŽ“ Key Learnings

### What Worked Well:
1. **GPT-4o-mini** is excellent for cost-effective analysis (avg $0.0002/event)
2. **Confidence scoring** auto-flags 10% of mappings for review (good balance)
3. **Recharts** provides powerful, responsive visualizations out of the box
4. **shadcn/ui** accelerates UI development with consistent, accessible components
5. **Structured feedback loop** makes human-in-the-loop practical at scale

### Challenges Overcome:
1. Database schema evolution (missing columns handled gracefully)
2. Alembic migration linearization (resolved branchpoints)
3. React state management (proper useEffect patterns)
4. Confidence threshold tuning (0.7 threshold captures right events)

### Future Improvements:
1. Add A/B testing for different LLM prompts
2. Track inter-rater reliability when multiple reviewers approve
3. Implement "suggest correction" instead of just approve/reject
4. Add bulk actions (approve all high-confidence, reject all low)
5. Create dashboard showing reviewer accuracy over time
