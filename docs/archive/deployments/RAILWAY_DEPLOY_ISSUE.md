# 🚨 Immediate Action Required: Railway Not Deploying

**Issue**: Railway API still returning 404 on new Sprint 7 endpoints  
**Status**: Code is correct, Railway just needs to redeploy

---

## ✅ What's Confirmed Working

1. ✅ **Code is in GitHub main branch**
   - Commits: `6ca4548`, `c959c2e`, `c55b5ee`, `47d15c2`
   - `/v1/digests` endpoints exist in `main.py` lines 2645-2714
   - All Sprint 7 files present

2. ✅ **Vercel frontend deployed** (showing new digest page)

3. ❌ **Railway backend NOT updated yet**
   - Still returning 404 on `/v1/digests`
   - Means it's running old code

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy in Railway Dashboard (FASTEST)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Find your `agi-tracker-api` service**
3. **Click on the service** 
4. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
5. **Click "Redeploy"** button (top right)
6. **Select latest commit** (`e565c06` or `32f3d99`)
7. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

### Option 2: Check Railway Watch Settings

Railway might not be watching the `main` branch properly:

1. Go to Railway service settings
2. Check "Source" → "Branch" is set to `main`
3. Check "Watch Paths" - should include `services/etl/` or be empty (watches all)
4. Check "Root Directory" - should be empty or `/` (not `services/etl`)

### Option 3: Check Railway Build Logs

The deployment might be failing silently:

1. Railway dashboard → agi-tracker-api service
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Find most recent deployment attempt
4. Click on it to see logs
5. Look for errors like:
   - Build failures
   - Missing dependencies
   - Import errors

## 🧪 Test When Ready

Once Railway deploys, verify with:

```bash
# Should return {"digests": [], "count": 0} instead of {"detail": "Not Found"}
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests

# Check API docs page - should list new endpoints
open https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/docs
```

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status | Version |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **GitHub main** | ✅ Up to date | e565c06 |
| **Vercel** | ✅ Deployed | Latest |
| **Railway** | ❌ Outdated | Pre-Sprint-7 |

---

## 💡 Most Likely Cause

**Railway is configured to watch a specific branch/path that doesn't include your changes.**

Common Railway misconfigurations:
- ❌ Branch set to `production` instead of `main`
- ❌ Root directory set to `services/etl` (breaks Dockerfile)
- ❌ Watch paths too restrictive
- ❌ Auto-deploy disabled

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

**In Railway Dashboard:**

1. **Check Service Settings**
   - Source → Branch = `main` ✅
   - Root Directory = `/` or empty ✅
   - Watch Paths = empty or includes `services/` ✅

2. **Check Deployments Tab**
   - Should see deployment triggered after `e565c06`
   - If not, manually click "Redeploy"

3. **Check for Errors**
   - Build logs might show why it's not deploying
   - Common: missing dependencies, syntax errors

---

## 🚀 Once Fixed

After Railway redeploys successfully:

```bash
# All these should work:
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/events/1/consensus
```

Then visit:
- https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/digests (will load without errors)
- https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/events (retraction UI will work)

---

**Action Required**: Please check Railway dashboard and manually trigger redeploy if needed.

**ETA**: 2-3 minutes after manual redeploy initiated
