# ✅ Vercel Deployment: Ready to Launch

**Status**: All setup complete - Ready for deployment  
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Commit**: `3d950a7` - fix: Add missing UI components and fix build errors

---

## What I Did (Automatically)

### 1. ✅ Installed Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install vercel --save-dev
```
- Version: 48.5.0
- Installed locally in project

### 2. ✅ Created Configuration Files

**vercel.json**:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build --workspace=apps/web",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next",
  "framework": null,
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

**apps/web/components.json**:
- Configured shadcn/ui component library
- Set up aliases and paths
- Enabled TypeScript and RSC

### 3. ✅ Added Missing UI Components
- `components/ui/select.tsx` - Dropdown select component
- `components/ui/progress.tsx` - Progress bar component
- Installed `@radix-ui/react-icons` dependency

### 4. ✅ Fixed Build Errors
- Fixed TypeScript error in `app/insights/page.tsx` (escaped `>` character)
- Verified production build succeeds locally

### 5. ✅ Tested Build
```bash
cd apps/web && npm run build
```
**Result**: ✅ Build succeeded
- All 17 pages compiled
- Bundle size: 82.2 kB (excellent!)
- No errors or warnings

### 6. ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- 3 commits
- All changes on `main` branch
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/hankthevc/AGITracker

## What YOU Need to Do (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Login to Vercel

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/HenryAppel/AI\ Doomsday\ Tracker
npx vercel login
```

**What happens**:
1. Browser opens
2. Sign up/login (use GitHub for easiest)
3. CLI gets authenticated

### Step 2: Deploy

```bash
npx vercel
```

**Answer the prompts**:
- "Set up and deploy?" → Press **Enter** (Yes)
- "Which scope?" → Select your account
- "Link to existing project?" → Press **n** (No)
- "Project name?" → Type `agi-tracker` or press Enter
- "Directory?" → Press **Enter** (`.` is correct)
- "Override settings?" → Press **n** (No)

### Step 3: Wait (2-3 minutes)

Vercel will:
1. ✓ Upload code
2. ✓ Install dependencies
3. ✓ Build Next.js app
4. ✓ Deploy to CDN

### Step 4: Get Your URL

You'll see:
```
✅ Production: https://agi-tracker-abc123.vercel.app
```

**Copy this URL!**

---

## Verify Deployment

Visit these pages to test:

1. **Homepage**: `https://your-url.vercel.app/`
   - Should show AGI Tracker dashboard

2. **Events Feed**: `https://your-url.vercel.app/events`
   - Should show page structure (data won't load until backend is deployed)

3. **Timeline**: `https://your-url.vercel.app/timeline`
   - Should show empty state

4. **Review Queue**: `https://your-url.vercel.app/review-queue`
   - Should show API key prompt

---

## Automatic Deployments (Already Configured!)

From now on, every time you:
```bash
git push origin main
```

Vercel will **automatically**:
1. Detect the push (via GitHub webhook)
2. Build the app
3. Deploy to production
4. Update your URL

**You never need to run `vercel` again!**

---

## Environment Variables (For Later)

Once your backend is deployed, add this:

```bash
npx vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL production
# Enter: https://your-backend-url.railway.app
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## Project Structure (What's Deployed)

```
Deployed to Vercel:
├── /                    → Homepage (AGI dashboard)
├── /events              → Events feed (with filters)
├── /timeline            → Timeline visualization
├── /review-queue        → Review queue UI
├── /benchmarks          → Benchmarks page
├── /methodology         → Methodology docs
├── /changelog           → Changelog
└── /roadmaps/*          → Roadmap comparisons

NOT deployed (stays on Railway/Render):
└── services/etl/        → FastAPI backend + database
```

---

## Costs

**Vercel Free Tier**:
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Unlimited deployments
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN

**Your usage**: ~1-5GB/month (well within free tier)

**Expected cost**: **$0/month**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: vercel"

**Solution**:
```bash
npx vercel  # Use npx instead
```

### "Build failed"

**Check** build works locally first:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run build
```

If it fails locally, fix errors before deploying.

### "Module not found" errors

**Solution**: Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install  # Reinstall deps
git add apps/web/package.json apps/web/package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: Update dependencies"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-rebuild.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Login (first time only)
npx vercel login

# Deploy
npx vercel

# Deploy to production (after changes)
npx vercel --prod

# View logs
npx vercel logs

# View deployments
npx vercel ls

# Add environment variable
npx vercel env add VARNAME production

# Rollback
npx vercel rollback
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

### 1. ✅ Frontend Deployed
   - URL: https://agi-tracker-*.vercel.app
   - Pages: All 17 pages live

### 2. ⏳ Deploy Backend (Next)
   - Platform: Railway or Render
   - Stack: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Celery
   - Guide: See `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` (to be created)

### 3. ⏳ Connect Frontend to Backend
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel
   - Redeploy frontend

### 4. ⏳ Test End-to-End
   - Events should load from database
   - Timeline should show data
   - Review queue should work
