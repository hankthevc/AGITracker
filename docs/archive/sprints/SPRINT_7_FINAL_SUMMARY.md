---

## 🎉 What We Accomplished

Sprint 7 successfully implemented **all 4 tasks** with 100% completion:

### ✅ Task 7.1: Live News Scraping
**Goal**: Replace fixtures with real-time RSS feeds

**Delivered**:
- Enabled `scrape_real=True` by default in config
- Added 3-second rate limiting between all requests
- Configured 14+ RSS feeds:
  - arXiv (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL)
  - OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, Meta AI, Cohere, Mistral, Adept
  - Reuters AI, AP Technology
- All feeds respect robots.txt (official RSS endpoints)
- Deduplication via `dedup_hash` already implemented

**Files Modified**:
- `services/etl/app/config.py`
- `services/etl/app/tasks/news/ingest_arxiv.py`
- `services/etl/app/tasks/news/ingest_company_blogs.py`
- `services/etl/app/tasks/news/ingest_press_reuters_ap.py`

---

### ✅ Task 7.2: Weekly Digest Generation
**Goal**: Auto-generate weekly AI progress summaries

**Delivered**:
- Enhanced `generate_weekly_digest()` to save JSON files
- Rich metadata: headline, key_moves, analysis, velocity, outlook, surprise_factor
- API endpoints:
  - `GET /v1/digests` - List all digests
  - `GET /v1/digests/{date}` - Get specific digest
- Frontend page at `/digests` with:
  - Card-based UI showing past 12 weeks
  - Tier breakdown badges (A/B/C)
  - Color-coded surprise factors
  - Links to featured events

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/app/digests/page.tsx` (377 lines)

**Files Modified**:
- `services/etl/app/tasks/analyze/generate_weekly_digest.py`
- `services/etl/app/main.py`

**Example Digest Structure**:
```json
{
  "headline": "Week's most important development",
  "key_moves": ["AI achieves X", "Lab announces Y"],
  "what_it_means": "Analysis paragraph...",
  "velocity_assessment": "Progress assessment",
  "outlook": "What to watch next",
  "surprise_factor": 7.5,
  "week_start": "2025-10-21",
  "week_end": "2025-10-28",
  "num_events": 15,
  "tier_breakdown": {"A": 5, "B": 8, "C": 2},
  "featured_events": [...]
}
```

### ✅ Task 7.3: Multi-Model Consensus Analysis
**Goal**: Compare outputs from GPT-4o-mini and Claude

**Delivered**:
- Added Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet support
- Multi-model analysis service (`multi_model_analysis.py`, 480 lines)
- Consensus scoring based on significance variance:
  - Variance ≤ 0.01: Strong Consensus (1.0)
  - Variance ≤ 0.10: Consensus (0.7-0.9)
  - Variance > 0.10: High Variance (<0.7) - flagged
- Cost tracking per model:
  - Claude: $3/$15 per 1M tokens (input/output)
  - GPT-4o-mini: $0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens
- API endpoint: `GET /v1/events/{id}/consensus`
- Frontend component: `ConsensusIndicator.tsx`

**Files Created**:
- `services/etl/app/services/multi_model_analysis.py` (480 lines)
- `apps/web/components/events/ConsensusIndicator.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `services/etl/app/config.py` (added ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- `services/etl/app/main.py` (consensus endpoint)
- `requirements.txt` (added anthropic>=0.40.0)

**How It Works**:
1. Event analyzed by both GPT-4o-mini and Claude
2. Significance scores compared
3. Variance calculated
4. Consensus score computed
5. High-variance events flagged for review

---

### ✅ Bonus Task 6.1: Retraction UI
**Goal**: Visual indicators for retracted events

**Delivered**:
- `RetractionBanner.tsx` component with destructive alert styling
- Integrated into `EventCard.tsx`
- Shows:
  - Retraction date
  - Reason for retraction
  - Evidence URL
- Visual indicators:
  - Line-through on title
  - Reduced opacity
  - Red "RETRACTED" badge
- Backend endpoint already existed at `/v1/admin/retract`

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/components/events/RetractionBanner.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/components/events/EventCard.tsx`

**Retraction Workflow**:
1. Admin calls `POST /v1/admin/retract` with event_id, reason, evidence_url
2. Backend marks event as retracted, creates changelog entry
3. Caches invalidated for affected signposts
4. Frontend shows `RetractionBanner` on retracted events
5. Event excluded from all gauge calculations

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### What's Deployed

#### ✅ GitHub Repository
- Branch: `main`
- Latest commit: `842b85e`
- Status: All Sprint 7 code pushed
- Link: https://github.com/hankthevc/AGITracker

#### ✅ Vercel Frontend
- URL: https://agi-tracker.vercel.app
- Status: Deployed successfully
- New pages:
  - `/digests` - Weekly digest listing
- Updated components:
  - `EventCard` - Retraction support
  - New: `ConsensusIndicator`, `RetractionBanner`

#### ⚠️ Railway Backend
- **Current Status**: Needs manual redeploy
- **Issue**: Two services exist, production points to old one
- **Solution**: Redeploy old service from GitHub main

**Service Status**:
```
Service 1: api-production-8535.up.railway.app (NEW)
├─ Code: Sprint 7 ✅
├─ Database: Empty ❌
└─ Domain: Not production

Service 2: agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app (OLD)
├─ Code: Pre-Sprint 7 ❌
├─ Database: Full ✅
└─ Domain: Production ✅
```

### What Needs to Happen

**Action Required**: Redeploy `agi-tracker-api-production` service in Railway

**Steps** (10 minutes):
1. Railway dashboard → Find `agi-tracker-api-production` service
2. Deployments → Deploy → Select "GitHub: main"
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for build
4. Test endpoints (see verification below)

**Detailed Instructions**: See `SPRINT_7_ACTION_PLAN.md`

---

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

After Railway deployment completes, run these tests:

### Backend API Tests
```bash
# 1. Sprint 7.1: Live scraping enabled
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","service":"agi-tracker-api","version":"1.0.0"}

# 2. Sprint 7.2: Digest endpoints
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests
# Expected: {"digests":[],"count":0}
# (Empty is normal - digests run weekly on Sundays)

curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests/2025-10-28
# Expected: 404 (no digest for this date yet)

# 3. Sprint 7.3: Consensus endpoint
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/events/1/consensus
# Expected: 200 with consensus data OR 404 if event not analyzed

# 4. Verify existing endpoints still work
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/events | jq '.total'
# Expected: Number > 0 (your event count)

curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/signposts | jq '. | length'
# Expected: 34

# 5. Check API docs
open https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/docs
# Should see new "digests" tag with 2 endpoints
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# 1. Digest page loads
open https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/digests
# Should show page (may say "No digests available" - normal)
# Check browser console - no errors

# 2. Event cards support retraction
# (Need to retract an event to test visually)

# 3. Consensus indicators
# (Will show when multi-model analysis runs)
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `/v1/digests` returns `{"digests":[],"count":0}`
- [ ] API docs show new endpoints
- [ ] Frontend `/digests` page loads without errors
- [ ] Existing endpoints still work (events, signposts, index)
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Health endpoint returns OK

## 💰 Cost Implications

### LLM Costs
**Weekly Digest** (runs Sundays):
- Cost: ~$0.50 per digest
- Model: gpt-4o-mini
- Monthly: ~$2

**Multi-Model Analysis** (per event):
- GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.01 per event
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~$0.05 per event (if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set)
- Default: Only GPT-4o-mini (saves money)

**Live News Scraping**:
- Cost: $0 (RSS feeds are free)
- Rate: 3 seconds between requests (respectful)

**Total Estimated Monthly Cost**: $5-20 depending on event volume and whether Claude is enabled

### Infrastructure Costs
- Railway: No change (same services)
- Vercel: No change (static hosting)
- Database: No change (same Neon instance)
