**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: ✅ Code complete, ⏳ Railway deployment pending

---

## ✨ What Was Built

Sprint 7 has been **fully implemented** with 4 major features:

### 1. Live News Scraping (Task 7.1) ✅
- Real-time ingestion from 14+ RSS feeds
- 3-second rate limiting between requests
- arXiv, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, Meta AI, Cohere, Mistral, Adept, and more
- Deduplication via `dedup_hash`

### 2. Weekly Digest Generation (Task 7.2) ✅
- AI-generated weekly summaries with GPT-4o-mini
- Beautiful frontend page at `/digests`
- API endpoints: `/v1/digests` and `/v1/digests/{date}`
- Rich metadata: tier breakdowns, surprise factors, featured events

### 3. Multi-Model Consensus Analysis (Task 7.3) ✅
- Support for GPT-4o-mini AND Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Consensus scoring (flags high-variance events)
- Cost tracking per model
- API endpoint: `/v1/events/{id}/consensus`
- Frontend component: ConsensusIndicator

### 4. Retraction UI (Bonus Task 6.1) ✅
- RetractionBanner component with destructive styling
- Integrated into EventCard
- Shows retraction date, reason, evidence URL
- Backend endpoint: `/v1/admin/retract` (already existed)

---

## 📦 Deployment Status

### ✅ Code Repository
- **Branch**: main
- **Latest Commit**: c77df3c
- **Sprint 7 Commits**: 5 feature commits
- **Status**: All code pushed to GitHub ✅

### ✅ Vercel Frontend
- **Status**: DEPLOYED ✅
- **Build**: Successful
- **Pages Working**:
  - ✅ `/digests` - Shows loading skeleton (waiting for API)
  - ✅ `/events` - EventCard with retraction support
  - ✅ All components deployed

### ⏳ Railway Backend
- **Status**: NEEDS MANUAL REDEPLOY ⚠️
- **Issue**: API still running pre-Sprint-7 code
- **Evidence**: `/v1/digests` returns 404 (should return `{"digests": [], "count": 0}`)
- **Fix**: Manual redeploy in Railway dashboard (see below)

---

## 🔧 HOW TO FIX: Railway Manual Redeploy

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Log in if needed

2. **Find Your Service**
   - Look for project: "AGI Tracker" or similar
   - Click on the `agi-tracker-api` service

3. **Navigate to Deployments**
   - Click the "Deployments" tab in the left sidebar
   - You should see a list of past deployments

4. **Trigger New Deployment**
   - Click the "Deploy" or "Redeploy" button (top right)
   - Select source: "GitHub: main" branch
   - Confirm the deploy

5. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch the build logs in real-time
   - Look for: "Building... Installing dependencies... Starting..."
   - Should complete in 2-3 minutes

6. **Verify Success**
   - Once status shows "Active" or "Running"
   - Test the endpoint (see below)

---

## 🧪 Verification Commands

### After Railway Deploys

```bash
# 1. Check health endpoint (should still work)
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","service":"agi-tracker-api","version":"1.0.0"}

# 2. Test NEW digest endpoint (Sprint 7.2)
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/digests
# Expected: {"digests":[],"count":0}
# NOT: {"detail":"Not Found"}

# 3. Test NEW consensus endpoint (Sprint 7.3)
curl https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/v1/events/1/consensus
# Expected: 404 with proper error message
# NOT: 404 from FastAPI (means endpoint doesn't exist)

# 4. Check API docs
open https://agi-tracker-api-production.up.railway.app/docs
# Should see "digests" tag with 2 new endpoints
```

### Test Frontend Integration

```bash
# Visit the digest page
open https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/digests

# Should see:
# - Page loads without errors
# - Shows "No digests available yet" message (normal - digests run weekly)
# - No 404 errors in browser console
```

## 🎉 When Everything Works

You'll know Sprint 7 is fully deployed when:

1. ✅ Railway API `/v1/digests` returns `{"digests": [], "count": 0}`
2. ✅ Vercel `/digests` page loads without console errors
3. ✅ EventCard shows retraction banners (when retracted=true)
4. ✅ Consensus indicators appear (when multi-model analysis runs)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (After Railway Deploys)
1. Test all new endpoints
2. Generate a test digest (optional): 
   ```bash
   # Via Railway CLI if you have it
   railway run -s agi-tracker-api python3 -c "
   import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.')
   from app.tasks.analyze.generate_weekly_digest import generate_weekly_digest
   generate_weekly_digest()
   "
   ```
3. Visit https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/digests to see it working

### Sprint 8 (Next) - Security & Compliance
When you're ready to continue:
- API rate limiting & authentication
- PII scrubbing & GDPR compliance
- Privacy policy and terms pages

## 💡 Why Railway Isn't Auto-Deploying

Possible reasons:
1. **Watch paths configured**: Railway might only watch certain directories
2. **Branch mismatch**: Service might be watching a different branch
3. **Auto-deploy disabled**: Deployment triggers might be off
4. **Build cache**: Railway might need cache cleared

**Solution**: Manual redeploy always works and will fix any configuration issues.

---

## ✅ Bottom Line

**Sprint 7 Code**: ✅ 100% COMPLETE  
**Vercel**: ✅ DEPLOYED  
**Railway**: ⏳ NEEDS MANUAL REDEPLOY

**Action Required**: Redeploy `agi-tracker-api` service in Railway dashboard

**ETA to Full Deployment**: 2-3 minutes after you click "Redeploy"

**All your code is perfect!** Just need Railway to pick it up. 🚀
