## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixed

**The Issue**: `query_active_events()` was generating `WHERE false` in SQL, returning 0 events

**Location**: `services/etl/app/utils/query_helpers.py` line 28

**Fix**:
```python
# Before (BROKEN)
return query.filter(not Event.retracted)  # Generated: WHERE false

# After (FIXED)
return query.filter(Event.retracted.is_(False))  # Generates: WHERE retracted = FALSE
```

**Commit**: `b582b11` - "fix(critical): Fix query_active_events filter"

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### Railway Environment Variables (All Services)
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://neondb_owner:npg_yavEY2uerBL8@ep-dark-wave-afrobklh-pooler.c-2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
REDIS_URL=[auto-generated by Railway]
OPENAI_API_KEY=[set]
ADMIN_API_KEY=[set]
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=[optional - not set]
```

**Important**: All services must use the **same** DATABASE_URL (with `.c-2` in hostname)

### Frontend Environment Variables (Vercel)
No environment variables needed - hardcoded fallback URLs updated to correct Railway domain.

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### 1. Railway Service Management
- **Issue**: Had duplicate API services causing confusion
- **Solution**: Deleted redundant services, kept one production service
- **Note**: Railway domain is `agitracker-production-6efa.up.railway.app` (not the old URL)

### 2. Database URL Issues
- **Issue**: Missing `.c-2` in Neon hostname caused auth failures
- **Correct**: `...afrobklh-pooler.c-2.us-west-2...`
- **Wrong**: `...afrobklh-pooler.us-west-2...`

### 3. SQLAlchemy Filter Bug
- **Issue**: Python `not` operator doesn't work with SQLAlchemy expressions
- **Solution**: Use `.is_(False)` or `not_()` function instead
- **Impact**: This was returning 0 events for ALL queries!

### 4. Deployment Verification
- **Issue**: Assumed Railway auto-deployed, but it didn't
- **Solution**: Always manually verify and redeploy if needed
- **Tip**: Check deployment timestamp in Railway dashboard

## 🎯 What's Working

### API Endpoints (All Tested ✅)
```bash
# Core endpoints
GET /health → 200 OK
GET /v1/events → 33 events
GET /v1/signposts → 34 signposts
GET /v1/index → Returns 0.0 (insufficient data - normal)

# Sprint 7 endpoints
GET /v1/digests → {"digests":[],"count":0} (empty - runs weekly)
GET /v1/events/{id}/consensus → Ready for multi-model analysis
POST /v1/admin/retract → Retraction workflow ready
```

### Frontend Pages (All Working ✅)
- `/` - Home page
- `/events` - Shows 33 events
- `/digests` - Shows "No digests available yet"
- All other pages functional

### Automated Tasks (Scheduled in Celery Beat ✅)
- News ingestion: Twice daily
- Weekly digest: Sundays 8 AM UTC
- Credibility snapshots: Daily 9 AM UTC

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Index at 0.0**: Normal - need more real-world data to move gauges
2. **No digests yet**: First digest generates next Sunday
3. **Consensus analysis**: Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude (optional)
4. **Empty events**: Current 33 events are from fixtures, live scraping will add more

## 📋 Next Sprint Recommendations

### Sprint 8: Security & Compliance (High Priority)
- API rate limiting & authentication
- API key management system
- PII scrubbing & GDPR compliance
- Privacy policy and terms pages

**Why**: Production API is currently unprotected and needs security hardening.

**Estimated Time**: 5-7 hours

**Files to Create**:
- `apps/web/app/legal/privacy/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/legal/terms/page.tsx`
- `services/etl/app/middleware/auth.py` (enhanced)
- API key management endpoints

### Alternative: Sprint 9: Performance & Scale
- Database query optimization
- Frontend performance (Lighthouse >90)
- Cursor-based pagination
- Cache optimization

**Why**: Good foundation work, less urgent than security.

## 🧪 Quick Health Check

Run this to verify everything is working:

```bash
cd "/Users/HenryAppel/AI Doomsday Tracker" && ./TEST_FIXED.sh
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Events count: 33
Sample event titles: [real events]
Index values: {overall: 0.0, ...} (0 is normal)
```
