## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Deployment

### 1. Dockerfile Path Resolution
**Problem**: Railway couldn't find Dockerfile when root directory set to `services/etl`  
**Solution**: Moved Dockerfile to repo root with paths prefixed `services/etl/`

### 2. Missing Packages Directory
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'packages'`  
**Solution**: Added `COPY packages /app/packages` to Dockerfile

### 3. weights.json Path Issue
**Problem**: `FileNotFoundError: /packages/shared/config/weights.json`  
**Solution**: Updated `snap_index.py` to check Docker path first (`/app/packages/...`)

### 4. Worker Out of Memory (OOM)
**Problem**: Worker tried to spawn 48 processes, exceeded Railway memory limits  
**Solution**: Reduced concurrency to 2 with `--concurrency=2` flag

### 5. REDIS_URL Configuration
**Problem**: `ValueError: Redis URL must specify redis:// scheme`  
**Solution**: Set `REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}` on worker and beat services

### 6. DATABASE_URL Configuration
**Problem**: Services trying to connect to localhost:5432  
**Solution**: Set `DATABASE_URL` with Neon connection string on all services

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Railway Deployment Tips

1. **Dockerfile location**: Keep at repo root when services have different root directories
2. **Memory limits**: Default Railway tier is ~512MB - reduce Celery concurrency accordingly
3. **Variable references**: `${{Service.VAR}}` syntax works but must be typed, not pasted
4. **Health checks**: Services without HTTP endpoints may show as "crashed" but still work
5. **Shared packages**: Monorepos need careful COPY commands and PYTHONPATH setup

### Production Readiness

- ✅ All critical services deployed and operational
- ✅ Automated task scheduling working
- ✅ Database connections stable
- ✅ Redis caching operational
- ✅ LLM budget tracking in place ($50/day limit)
- ✅ Task monitoring and observability ready
- ⚠️ Worker OOM requires ongoing monitoring (may need upgrade)
- ⚠️ Some scheduled tasks haven't run yet (wait for scheduled times)
