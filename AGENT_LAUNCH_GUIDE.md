# 🚀 Agent Launch Guide - Simple Instructions

**Status**: ✅ Ready to Launch  
**Agent Prompts Created**: 4 files  
**Estimated Time**: 2 minutes to launch all agents

## 📋 Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Cursor Composer (4 times)

**For each agent, do this:**

1. Press **Cmd+I** (Mac) or **Ctrl+I** (Windows/Linux)
2. This opens a Composer window
3. Repeat 4 times (or open 4 separate Composer windows)

### Step 2: Configure Each Composer

In **each** Composer window:

1. Click the **Agent icon** 🤖 (or ensure Agent mode is enabled)
2. Toggle **Web Search** ON 🌐 (very important!)

### Step 3: Launch Agents

Copy-paste the full content of each file into a Composer window:

#### Composer Window 1: DevOps Engineer
```bash
# Open this file:
AGENT_PROMPT_1_DEVOPS.md

# Copy ALL contents (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
# Paste into Composer 1 (Cmd+V)
# Click "Start" or press Enter
```

#### Composer Window 2: Features Engineer  
```bash
# Open this file:
AGENT_PROMPT_2_FEATURES.md

# Copy ALL contents (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
# Paste into Composer 2 (Cmd+V)
# Click "Start" or press Enter
```

#### Composer Window 3: AI/ML Engineer
```bash
# Open this file:
AGENT_PROMPT_3_AI_ML.md

# Copy ALL contents (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
# Paste into Composer 3 (Cmd+V)
# Click "Start" or press Enter
```

#### Composer Window 4: Documentation Specialist
```bash
# Open this file:
AGENT_PROMPT_4_DOCS.md

# Copy ALL contents (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
# Paste into Composer 4 (Cmd+V)
# Click "Start" or press Enter
```

- Commits being pushed
- PRs being opened

### Check Terminal
If agents run commands, you'll see output in Cursor's terminal panel

---

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Agent Gets Stuck
- Read the last message
- It might be waiting for clarification
- Respond to unblock it

### Agent Asks for Credentials
- It might need API keys or tokens
- Provide what it asks for
- Or tell it to skip that part

### Agent Makes a Mistake

- Or let it finish and fix in code review
- Agents can iterate and improve

3. **Be patient** - Complex tasks take 12-48 hours
4. **Review PRs carefully** - Test locally before merging
5. **Agents can ask questions** - Check Composer for questions
