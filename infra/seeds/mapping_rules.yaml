# Event-to-Signpost Mapping Rules (v0.3)
#
# Rules for mapping news events to signposts using keyword/phrase matching.
# Each rule specifies patterns to match and the target signpost code.
#
# Structure:
# - pattern: string or regex to match in title/summary (case-insensitive)
#   signpost_code: target signpost code  
#   confidence: base confidence score (0.0-1.0)
#   category: capabilities|agents|inputs|security
#   synonyms: alternative terms (optional)

  usage_notes: |
    - Patterns are case-insensitive by default
    - Use regex syntax for flexible matching (e.g., "10\\^26" matches "10^26")
    - Multiple rules can fire for the same event
    - Confidence scores are combined (take max) when multiple rules match
    - Events with confidence < 0.6 are flagged for manual review
