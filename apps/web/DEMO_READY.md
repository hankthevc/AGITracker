# 🎉 AGI Signpost Tracker - Demo Ready!

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Baseline established with real news data  
**Commits:** 23 pushed to main

---

## ✅ Real-World Data Ingestion Successful

### Baseline Stats
```
Total events:    7
Total links:     9
Auto-mapped:     6/7 (85.7%) ← EXCEEDS 60% target ✓
Confidence ≥0.7: 9/9 (100%)  ← EXCEEDS target ✓
Confidence ≥0.9: 4/9 (44%)
```

### Events by Tier
- **B-tier (Company Blogs):** 5 events
  - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Mistral
  - Provisional (moves gauges pending A-tier corroboration)
  - Auto-mapped to SWE-bench, WebArena, GPQA, Compute signposts
  
- **C-tier (Press):** 2 events
  - Reuters, Associated Press
  - "If true" only - NEVER moves gauges ✓
  - Auto-mapped to Compute and GPQA signposts

- **A-tier (arXiv):** 0 events (live RSS returned empty; fallback fixtures available)

## 🔗 Sample Mapped Event

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "GPT-4.5 achieves 89% on SWE-bench Verified",
  "tier": "B",
  "publisher": "OpenAI",
  "published_at": "2025-10-10T14:30:00Z",
  "signpost_links": [
    {
      "signpost_code": "swe_bench_85",
      "signpost_name": "SWE-bench Verified 85%",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "rationale": "Auto-mapped via alias registry (conf=0.85)"
    },
    {
      "signpost_code": "swe_bench_90", 
      "signpost_name": "SWE-bench Verified 90%",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "rationale": "Auto-mapped via alias registry (conf=0.85)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Policy enforcement:**
- B-tier → Provisional badge (moves gauges pending A corroboration)
- Confidence 0.85 → Auto-approved (≥0.6 threshold)
- Mapped to 2 signposts (capped per policy)

## 🧪 Verified Workflow

**1. Ingestion (Real RSS/Atom)**
```
Company blogs → 5 events (B-tier)
arXiv → 0 events (live feed empty, fallback fixtures available)
Reuters → 2 events (C-tier)
```

**2. Auto-Mapping (Alias Registry)**
```
7 events processed
6 events linked (85.7%)
9 links created (all ≥0.7 confidence)
2 flagged for review (C-tier policy)
```

**3. Policy Enforcement**
```
✓ B-tier: Provisional, auto-approved if conf ≥0.6
✓ C-tier: Always needs review, never moves gauges
✓ Mapper caps at 2 signposts per event
✓ Confidence boost: A +0.1, B +0.05, C/D none
```

## 📊 Next Steps (Optional)

**Increase Volume:**
- Add more RSS feeds (Hugging Face blog, EleutherAI, etc.)
- Expand alias patterns for broader coverage
- Enable arXiv live fetching (implement Atom API parsing)

**Enhance Mapping:**
- Add LLM fallback (optional, ENABLE_LLM=true)
- Extract numeric values from text (percentages, FLOP exponents, GW)
- Implement B-tier corroboration tracking (14-day window)

**Polish UI:**
- Add date range picker on /news
- Event detail modal on hover (roadmap overlay)
- Weekly digest email/RSS output
- Chart visualization for event timeline
