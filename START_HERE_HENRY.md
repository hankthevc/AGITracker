## 🚀 Quick Start (TL;DR)

### The Situation

**Expected**: 4 separate parallel branches to merge  
**Actual**: All work consolidated on ONE branch (`devops/complete-ci-cd-pipeline`)

**This branch contains**:
- ✅ DevOps automation (Agent 1) - CI/CD, Docker, pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Phase 3 features (Agent 2) - Signposts, presets, search, mobile, shortcuts
- ✅ Phase 4 features (Agent 3) - RAG chatbot, vector search
- ✅ Documentation (Agent 4) - Docusaurus site, 8 guides, troubleshooting

**Files changed**: 123 (109 added, 14 modified)  
**Lines added**: ~42,000+  
**Risk level**: Low (mostly new files, well-documented)  
**Breaking changes**: None!

### What You Need to Do

#### Step 1: Configure Secrets & Environment Variables (1 hour)
**Critical**: Before creating PR, configure:
- GitHub secrets (Vercel, Railway tokens)
- Vercel environment variables
- Railway environment variables

**Where**: See section 2 in `HUMAN_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED.md`

#### Step 2: Create the PR (5 minutes)
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "v0.4.0 - Complete CI/CD Pipeline + Phase 3 & 4 Features + Documentation" \
  --body-file UNIFIED_PR_DESCRIPTION.md \
  --base main \
  --head devops/complete-ci-cd-pipeline \
  --label "major-release"
```

Or use GitHub web UI and copy-paste `UNIFIED_PR_DESCRIPTION.md` as the description.

#### Step 3: Review & Merge (1-2 hours)
- Review code audits (`docs/*-audit.md`)
- Decide on feature flags (enable RAG chatbot or not?)
- Approve costs (~$0.50/month if RAG enabled)
- Merge PR

#### Step 4: Verify Deployment (10 minutes)
- Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- Check deployment succeeds
- Visit production site

#### Step 5: Manual Testing (30-45 minutes)
- Use `MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
- Test all new features
- Verify no regressions

#### Step 6: Deploy Documentation (15 minutes)
```bash
cd docs-site
npm install
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

#### Step 7: Monitor (24 hours)
- Check error rates
- Check API response times
- Check LLM costs (if RAG enabled)

## 💰 Cost Decision Required

**Current monthly cost**: ~$25  
**New monthly cost**: ~$25.50 (if Phase 4 RAG enabled)  
**Increase**: ~$0.50/month = ~$6/year

**Options**:
1. **Enable RAG features** (~$0.50/month) - Get chatbot, vector search, scenario explorer
2. **Keep RAG disabled** ($0 increase) - Phase 3 features only, enable RAG later

**My recommendation**: Start with RAG disabled, enable in Week 2 after monitoring Phase 3.

Set in Railway environment variables:
```bash
ENABLE_RAG_CHATBOT=false  # Enable in Week 2-3
ENABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH=false  # Enable in Week 2
ENABLE_SCENARIO_EXPLORER=true  # No cost, safe to enable
```
