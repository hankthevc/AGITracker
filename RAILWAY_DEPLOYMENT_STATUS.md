# Sprint 9/10 Deployment Status

## Current Status: ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS - Fixing Railway Deployment

### Timeline

**2025-10-29 - Sprint 9/10 Issues Detected**
- News and events pages showing "failed to load" 
- API returning HTTP 500 errors on `/v1/events` endpoint
- Root cause: Database migrations not applied on Railway

### Fixes Applied

**Commit df2fe46** - Add automatic database migrations on Railway startup
- Updated Dockerfile to copy migrations and alembic.ini into container
- Modified start_server.py to run `alembic upgrade head` before starting API
- Ensures migrations 018 and 019 are applied automatically

**Commit 1e8d10d** - Configure alembic to read DATABASE_URL from environment
- Removed hardcoded database URL from alembic.ini
- Updated env.py to handle both Docker and local development paths
- Ensures migrations connect to Railway's PostgreSQL database

**Commit b322894** - Add detailed logging to migration startup script
- Added diagnostic logging for debugging
- Logs DATABASE_URL presence, file paths, and full migration output
- Better error handling with tracebacks

**Frontend Fixes (Commits 13e8c00, 68d8b81, eaaac5a)**
- Separated Navigation into client component to restore metadata
- Made significance filter optional in backend
- Created troubleshooting documentation

### Required Migrations

These migrations need to be applied on Railway:

1. **018_add_performance_indexes.py** (Sprint 9)
   - 13 performance indexes for events, links, analysis, sources
   - Includes cursor pagination indexes
   - Full-text search (GIN) indexes

2. **019_add_url_validation.py** (Sprint 10)
   - `url_validated_at`, `url_status_code`, `url_is_valid`, `url_error` columns
   - Indexes for URL validation queries

### How to Verify Fix

Once Railway redeploys (takes 2-5 minutes after push):

```bash
# 1. Check API health
curl https://agitracker-production-6efa.up.railway.app/health

# 2. Test events endpoint
curl "https://agitracker-production-6efa.up.railway.app/v1/events?limit=2"

# Should return JSON with events array, not "Internal Server Error"
```

Frontend verification:
- https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/news
- https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/events

Both should load event data without errors.

### Railway Logs to Check

In Railway dashboard, check deployment logs for:
```
ðŸ”„ Running database migrations...
DATABASE_URL present: True
Migrations directory exists: True
Alembic.ini exists: True
âœ… Migrations completed successfully
```

If migrations fail, logs will show the specific error.

### Next Steps if Still Failing

1. Check Railway logs for specific migration errors
2. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is set on Railway
3. Manually trigger Railway redeploy
4. Check if Redis (REDIS_URL) is properly configured

### Alternative: Manual Migration

If automatic migrations continue to fail, migrations can be run manually:

1. Via Railway web dashboard: Settings > Database > Connect
2. Or via script: `railway run python -m alembic upgrade head`

**Next Check**: Wait 5 minutes for Railway rebuild, then test API endpoint
