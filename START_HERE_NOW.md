## ⚠️ The Issues (All Fixable)

### 1. Documentation Clutter (P0)
**Problem**: 80+ obsolete status files in root directory  
**Solution**: Run cleanup script (5 minutes)  
**Impact**: Professional repository appearance

### 2. Broken Migrations (P0)
**Problem**: Migrations 018, 020 disabled; columns commented out  
**Solution**: Create baseline migration, test on clean DB  
**Impact**: Reliable deployments

### 3. Deployment Confusion (P0)
**Problem**: 2 Railway services, unclear which is production  
**Solution**: Consolidate to single service  
**Impact**: Clear deployment workflow

### 4. No Live Data (P0)
**Problem**: Using fixtures instead of real RSS feeds  
**Solution**: Set SCRAPE_REAL=true, enable Celery Beat  
**Impact**: Actual useful dashboard

### 5. No Monitoring (P0)
**Problem**: Can't see errors or downtime in production  
**Solution**: Verify Sentry, add Healthchecks.io  
**Impact**: Observable system

## 🎓 Vision Alignment

**Your Vision**: "Neutral, reproducible system that ingests AI news and research, maps to AGI signposts from expert roadmaps, presents through clean dashboard with AI insights"

**What's Aligned**:
- ✅ Neutral (evidence tiers)
- ✅ Reproducible (versioned scoring)
- ✅ Expert roadmaps (Aschenbrenner, AI-2027, Cotra)
- ✅ Clean dashboard (Next.js + shadcn/ui)

**What Needs Work**:
- ⚠️ "Ingests AI news" - Using fixtures (fix: Week 2)
- ⚠️ "AI insights" - Exists but not prominent (fix: Week 4)
- ⚠️ "Viral-ready" - Missing social sharing (fix: Week 4)

**Gap**: 2-3 weeks from full vision alignment
