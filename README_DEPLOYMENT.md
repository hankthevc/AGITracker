## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Local Setup (Do These First)
```bash
# 1. Run database migrations
cd "/Users/HenryAppel/AI Doomsday Tracker/infra/migrations"
alembic upgrade head

# 2. Seed expert predictions
cd "/Users/HenryAppel/AI Doomsday Tracker/services/etl"
python -c "from app.tasks.predictions.seed_expert_predictions import seed_all_predictions; seed_all_predictions()"

# 3. Test mapper accuracy (optional)
pytest tests/test_mapper_accuracy.py -v
```

### Railway Deployment (Backend)
```bash
# Deploy API
cd "/Users/HenryAppel/AI Doomsday Tracker/services/etl"
railway login
railway init --name agi-tracker-api
railway up
```

Then add environment variables in Railway dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon PostgreSQL URL
- `REDIS_URL` - Auto-provided when you add Redis
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - From OpenAI platform
- `API_KEY` - Generate: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - Your Vercel URL (add after frontend deploy)

### Vercel Deployment (Frontend)
```bash
# Deploy frontend
cd "/Users/HenryAppel/AI Doomsday Tracker/apps/web"
vercel --prod

# Add API URL
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL production
# Enter: https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

### Verification
```bash
# Test API
curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health

# Visit frontend
open https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/events
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After deployment, verify these work:

### Immediate (5 minutes)
- [ ] API health check responds
- [ ] Frontend loads at /events
- [ ] Timeline shows at /timeline
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs

### After 24 Hours
- [ ] Events ingested automatically (check /events page)
- [ ] AI analysis generated (check "Why this matters" sections)
- [ ] Celery tasks running (check Railway logs)
- [ ] LLM costs under $5 (check /health/full)

### After 1 Week
- [ ] 50+ events ingested
- [ ] 100+ event→signpost links created
- [ ] Mapper F1 score >= 0.75 (run test)
- [ ] No manual interventions needed

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### API not responding
```bash
railway logs -s agi-tracker-api --follow
```

### Frontend shows "Cannot connect to API"
Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is set correctly in Vercel.

### No events showing up
```bash
# Manually trigger ingestion
cd "/Users/HenryAppel/AI Doomsday Tracker/services/etl"
python scripts/run_ingestors.py
```

### Database errors
```bash
# Verify connection
python -c "from app.database import engine; engine.connect(); print('✅ Connected')"
```
