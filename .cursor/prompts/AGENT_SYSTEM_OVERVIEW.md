# ü§ñ Agent Orchestration System - Complete Overview

**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Purpose**: Coordinate 6 parallel Cursor AI agents to complete AGI Tracker production readiness  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks from 70% ‚Üí 100% production-ready  
**Approach**: Parallel specialized agents with supervisory coordination

---

## üéØ What This System Does

Takes your AGI Tracker project from its current state (70% complete, functional prototype) to a fully production-ready, launch-worthy platform through coordinated parallel development by specialized AI agents.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of one AI agent doing everything sequentially, you have 6 specialist agents working in parallel with intelligent coordination to prevent conflicts and maximize velocity.

## üé¨ How to Use This System

### First-Time Setup (15 minutes)

1. **Review the Code Review**:
   ```bash
   cat CODE_REVIEW_2025.md
   # Understand the current state (70% complete)
   ```

2. **Read the Activation Guide**:
   ```bash
   cat .cursor/agents/ACTIVATION_GUIDE.md
   # Learn how to activate agents
   ```

3. **Activate Supervisor Agent**:
   - Open new Cursor window
   - Paste contents of `.cursor/agents/SUPERVISOR_AGENT.md`
   - Say: "You are the Supervisor Agent. Initialize the system."
   - Wait for initialization report

4. **Activate First Two Agents** (Parallel):
   - **DevOps Window**: Load `DEVOPS_AGENT.md`, start on migration repair
   - **Documentation Window**: Load `DOCUMENTATION_AGENT.md`, start on cleanup

5. **Monitor Progress**:
   ```bash
   # Daily standup (5 min/day)
   cat .cursor/agents/status/DAILY_STANDUP_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
   ```

### Daily Routine (5 minutes)

**Morning**:
1. Read daily standup
2. Check for blockers
3. Review Git activity
4. Check metrics

**Approvals**:
- Supervisor will ask for approval on major decisions
- Review and respond in the relevant agent window

**Evening**:
- Review day's progress
- Plan tomorrow's focus

### Weekly Checkpoints (30 minutes)

**Friday End-of-Week**:
1. Read weekly summary
2. Review checkpoint deliverables
3. Approve/adjust next week's plan
4. Celebrate progress!

## ü§ù How Agents Coordinate

### Conflict Prevention

1. **FILE_OWNERSHIP.md**: Clear file assignment
2. **Supervisor**: Monitors all agents, detects conflicts early
3. **Sequential Edits**: Shared files edited sequentially, not parallel
4. **Section Assignment**: Large files (main.py) divided by line ranges

### Communication Flow

```
Human
  ‚Üì
Supervisor Agent
  ‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DevOps Agent
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend Agent  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Agent
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Testing Agent
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Documentation Agent
```

**Daily Standups**: All agents ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Human  
**Decisions**: Human ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Relevant agent(s)  
**Blockers**: Agent ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Human (if needed)

### Integration Strategy

1. Each agent works in their own branch: `agent/[name]/[feature]`
2. Agent commits with tagged messages: `agent([name]): [description]`
3. Supervisor reviews and integrates: merges to main sequentially
4. Automated testing prevents regressions

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Migration Failures**:
- Mitigation: Test on clean DB before production
- Backup: Keep old service running 24h
- Recovery: Documented rollback procedures

**Live Ingestion Breaks**:
- Mitigation: Start with fixture mode, gradually enable
- Backup: Toggle SCRAPE_REAL=false
- Monitoring: Healthchecks.io alerts

**LLM Costs Spike**:
- Mitigation: Hard $50/day stop in Redis
- Monitoring: Daily spend tracking
- Fallback: Disable analysis, use rule-based

**Security Breach**:
- Mitigation: Regular audits, rate limiting
- Monitoring: Sentry error tracking
- Backup: Kill switch to disable API

### Organizational Risks

**Agent Conflicts**:
- Prevention: FILE_OWNERSHIP.md
- Detection: Daily standups
- Resolution: Supervisor coordination

**Scope Creep**:
- Prevention: Weekly checkpoint focus
- Detection: Supervisor monitors tasks
- Resolution: Defer to post-launch backlog

**Timeline Slip**:
- Monitoring: METRICS.md weekly
- Adjustment: Descope or extend timeline
- Communication: Supervisor escalates
