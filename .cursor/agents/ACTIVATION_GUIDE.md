## Quick Start

### Step 1: Activate Supervisor (5 minutes)

Open a new Cursor window and load the supervisor:

```bash
# In Cursor, open a new chat
# Paste the entire contents of:
cat .cursor/agents/SUPERVISOR_AGENT.md
```

Then say:
```
You are the Supervisor Agent. Initialize the agent coordination system:
1. Create the .cursor/agents/status/ directory
2. Create FILE_OWNERSHIP.md
3. Create WEEK_1_PLAN.md
4. Brief all other agents
5. Start DevOps and Documentation agents on Week 1 tasks

Report back when initialization is complete.
```

### Step 2: Activate DevOps & Documentation Agents (Parallel)

**DevOps Window**:
```bash
# New Cursor window
cat .cursor/agents/DEVOPS_AGENT.md

# Then say:
You are the DevOps Agent. Your Week 1 priorities are:
1. Fix migration chain (create migration 022)
2. Consolidate Railway services
3. Set up production monitoring

Start with Task 1: Migration Chain Repair.
Update your status in .cursor/agents/status/DEVOPS_status.md daily.
Report to Supervisor Agent.
```

**Documentation Window**:
```bash
# New Cursor window
cat .cursor/agents/DOCUMENTATION_AGENT.md

# Then say:
You are the Documentation Agent. Your Week 1 priority is:
1. Execute cleanup_docs.sh script
2. Archive 70+ obsolete files
3. Update README.md and QUICKSTART.md

Start with Task 1: Execute Documentation Cleanup.
Update your status in .cursor/agents/status/DOCUMENTATION_status.md daily.
Report to Supervisor Agent.
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress (Daily)

**Check Supervisor Dashboard**:
```bash
# View daily standup
cat .cursor/agents/status/DAILY_STANDUP_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# View agent status
cat .cursor/agents/status/DEVOPS_status.md
cat .cursor/agents/status/DOCUMENTATION_status.md
```

### Step 4: Activate Backend Agent (Week 2)

After DevOps fixes migrations:

```bash
# New Cursor window
cat .cursor/agents/BACKEND_AGENT.md

# Then say:
You are the Backend Agent. Your Week 2 priorities are:
1. Enable live data ingestion (SCRAPE_REAL=true)
2. Configure Celery Beat scheduling
3. Verify LLM budget limits

Start with Task 1: Enable Real Data Ingestion.
Coordinate with DevOps Agent on database schema.
Report to Supervisor Agent.
```

### Step 5: Activate Frontend & Testing Agents (Week 3)

**Frontend Window**:
```bash
cat .cursor/agents/FRONTEND_AGENT.md

# Then say:
You are the Frontend Agent. Your Week 3 priorities are:
1. Implement dark mode
2. Add PWA features
3. Create social sharing with OpenGraph

Start with Task 1: Dark Mode Implementation.
Report to Supervisor Agent.
```

**Testing Window**:
```bash
cat .cursor/agents/TESTING_AGENT.md

# Then say:
You are the Testing Agent. Your Week 3 priorities are:
1. Expand E2E test coverage to 80%
2. Run security audit
3. Perform load testing

Start with Task 1: Expand E2E Test Coverage.
Report to Supervisor Agent.
```

## Communication with Agents

### How to Give Instructions

Each agent operates independently but reports to Supervisor. You can:

1. **Talk to Individual Agents**:
   ```
   @DevOps: Can you add an alert for database connection failures?
   ```

2. **Talk to Supervisor**:
   ```
   @Supervisor: I need to prioritize mobile optimization. 
   Can you have Frontend Agent work on that before dark mode?
   ```

3. **Broadcast to All**:
   ```
   @All: We're presenting to investors on Friday. 
   Need a working demo by Thursday EOD.
   ```

### How to Get Updates

**Daily Standup** (auto-generated):
```bash
cat .cursor/agents/status/DAILY_STANDUP_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

**Weekly Summary**:
```bash
cat .cursor/agents/status/WEEK_1_SUMMARY.md
```

**Metrics Dashboard**:
```bash
cat .cursor/agents/status/METRICS.md
```

## Decision Points

### When You Must Approve

Agents will ask for approval on:
- Major architecture changes
- Database schema changes (new tables)
- Production deployment
- Security policy changes
- API breaking changes
- Feature scope changes

### When Agents Decide Autonomously

Agents can decide on:
- Task prioritization within weekly goals
- Code style and formatting
- Test coverage targets
- Documentation structure
- Minor bug fixes
- Performance optimizations

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Seems Stuck

1. Check their status file:
   ```bash
   cat .cursor/agents/status/[AGENT]_status.md
   ```

2. Check for blockers in daily standup:
   ```bash
   cat .cursor/agents/status/DAILY_STANDUP_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md | grep -A 5 "Blockers"
   ```

3. Ask Supervisor:
   ```
   @Supervisor: What's blocking Backend Agent?
   ```

### Merge Conflict

1. Supervisor should handle this automatically
2. If not, check FILE_OWNERSHIP.md
3. Reassign file ownership if needed

### Agent Made Wrong Decision

1. Provide feedback:
   ```
   @Agent: Please revert the change to X. 
   The correct approach is Y because Z.
   ```

2. Update their instructions:
   ```
   @Supervisor: Update [Agent]'s guidelines to include [new rule]
   ```
