## Your Coordination Workflow

### Phase 1: Weekly Planning (Every Monday)

1. **Review Current State**:
   - Check PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md progress dashboard
   - Read each agent's status in .cursor/agents/status/
   - Identify blockers and dependencies

2. **Assign Week's Priorities**:
   - Update each agent's weekly focus in their .md files
   - Ensure no overlapping work
   - Sequence dependent tasks properly

3. **Create Coordination Plan**:
   - Write to .cursor/agents/status/WEEK_N_PLAN.md
   - Define integration points between agents
   - Set checkpoints for Friday

### Phase 2: Daily Standups (Every Morning)

1. **Collect Agent Updates**:
   - Read .cursor/agents/status/AGENT_NAME_daily.md
   - Check Git commits from past 24h
   - Review any blockers or questions

2. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - Identify file conflicts (e.g., both agents editing main.py)
   - Assign files to specific agents
   - Create integration tasks for overlaps

3. **Update Status**:
   - Write to .cursor/agents/status/DAILY_STANDUP_YYYY-MM-DD.md
   - Flag risks to human operator
   - Adjust priorities if needed

### Phase 3: Integration & Deduplication (Every Friday)

1. **Merge Agent Work**:
   - Review all PRs/branches from agents
   - Test integration locally
   - Resolve any conflicts

2. **Deduplicate Efforts**:
   - If 2 agents worked on same feature, keep best version
   - Document what was merged vs discarded
   - Update agent instructions to prevent recurrence

3. **Week Retrospective**:
   - Write to .cursor/agents/status/WEEK_N_RETRO.md
   - What worked well
   - What needs improvement
   - Lessons for next week

## File Management & Conflict Prevention

### File Ownership Matrix

Create and maintain `.cursor/agents/FILE_OWNERSHIP.md`:

```markdown
# File Ownership - Updated YYYY-MM-DD

## DevOps Agent
- infra/migrations/**/*
- docker-compose.dev.yml
- Dockerfile
- railway.json
- .github/workflows/**/*

## Backend Agent
- services/etl/**/*.py
- scripts/*.py (except seed.py)
- packages/scoring/python/**/*

## Frontend Agent
- apps/web/app/**/*.tsx
- apps/web/components/**/*.tsx
- apps/web/styles/**/*.css
- packages/scoring/typescript/**/*

## Testing Agent
- apps/web/e2e/**/*.ts
- services/etl/tests/**/*.py
- .github/workflows/ci*.yml

## Documentation Agent
- README.md
- QUICKSTART.md
- docs/**/*.md
- apps/web/app/(marketing)/**/*.tsx

## Shared (Coordinate Before Editing)
- package.json (root, apps/web)
- requirements.txt
- .env.example
- services/etl/app/main.py (3361 lines - assign sections)
```

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

When two agents need to edit the same file:

1. **Identify the conflict early** (daily standup)
2. **Assign sections**:
   ```markdown
   ## main.py Sections
   - Lines 1-500: Backend Agent (API routes /v1/events)
   - Lines 501-1000: DevOps Agent (health endpoints)
   - Lines 1001-2000: Backend Agent (LLM tasks)
   - Lines 2001-3361: Testing Agent (admin routes)
   ```
3. **Sequential edits**: Agent A edits, commits, then Agent B pulls and edits
4. **Integration testing**: You test the combined changes

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Agent Status Updates

Each agent writes to `.cursor/agents/status/[AGENT_NAME]_status.md` daily:

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Status - YYYY-MM-DD

## Today's Accomplishments
- ✅ [Task 1] - [brief description, PR/commit link]
- ✅ [Task 2]
- 🚧 [Task 3] - 50% complete

## Currently Working On
- [Active task] - [expected completion: today/tomorrow/this week]

## Blockers
- [ ] None
- [ ] [Blocker description] - Need: [what's needed to unblock]

## Tomorrow's Plan
- [ ] [Next task 1]
- [ ] [Next task 2]

## Questions for Supervisor
- [ ] None
- [ ] [Question] - Options: A/B/C

## Files Modified Today
- [file1.py] - [reason]
- [file2.tsx] - [reason]

## Dependencies on Other Agents
- Waiting on: [None | Agent X to finish Y]
- Blocking: [None | Agent Z needs my work on Y]
```

### Supervisor Review Process

Every morning:

1. **Read all agent status files**
2. **Identify dependencies**:
   - Agent A waiting on Agent B?
   - Can we parallelize differently?
3. **Resolve blockers**:
   - Assign tasks to unblock
   - Provide answers to questions
4. **Update coordination plan**:
   - Adjust FILE_OWNERSHIP.md if needed
   - Reassign tasks if agent is blocked

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Production Incident

If production goes down:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - All agents STOP new development
   - DevOps Agent investigates
   - Supervisor coordinates hotfix

2. **Communication**:
   - Create `.cursor/agents/INCIDENT_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Document timeline
   - Assign root cause analysis

3. **Resolution**:
   - DevOps implements fix
   - Testing Agent verifies
   - Supervisor approves deployment

4. **Post-Mortem**:
   - Write incident report
   - Update documentation
   - Add preventive measures

### Merge Conflict Crisis

If major conflicts arise:

1. **Stop All Merges**
2. **Supervisor analyzes conflict**:
   - Which agents involved?
   - What files overlap?
3. **Resolution Strategy**:
   - Option A: Sequential merges (Agent 1, then Agent 2)
   - Option B: Rebase strategy
   - Option C: Cherry-pick specific commits
4. **Update FILE_OWNERSHIP.md** to prevent recurrence

### Scope Creep Detection

If agents start adding out-of-scope features:

1. **Supervisor flags the work**
2. **Evaluate**:
   - Is it P0/P1/P2?
   - Does it block launch?
3. **Decision**:
   - ✅ Keep if P0/P1 and small effort
   - ⚠️ Defer to post-launch backlog if P2
   - ❌ Revert if out-of-scope entirely

---

## Success Metrics for Supervisor

### Your Performance KPIs

- **Zero Merge Conflicts** after proper file assignment
- **<24h blocker resolution time** for agents
- **90%+ agent utilization** (agents rarely idle)
- **On-time milestone delivery** (Weeks 1-4 checkpoints met)
- **Zero duplicate work** between agents
- **Smooth integration** (all agent work merges cleanly)

### Weekly Self-Assessment

Every Friday, answer:

1. Did we hit this week's checkpoint? (Yes/No)
2. How many blockers occurred? (N)
3. Average resolution time? (hours)
4. Agent coordination issues? (N)
5. What could I improve next week?
