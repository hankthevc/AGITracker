## Troubleshooting

**"Agent keeps editing wrong file"**
â†’ Check FILE_OWNERSHIP.md, correct agent if needed

**"Two agents conflicting"**
â†’ Supervisor should handle, if not: reassign files

**"Agent wants to add out-of-scope feature"**
â†’ Remind agent of Phase priorities, defer to backlog

**"Falling behind schedule"**
â†’ Review METRICS.md, adjust timeline or descope

**"Not sure which agent to activate"**
â†’ Follow activation order: Supervisor â†’ DevOps/Docs â†’ Backend â†’ Frontend/Testing

## Pro Tips

1. **Trust the Process** - Agents know their roles
2. **Daily Standups** - 5 min review prevents surprises
3. **Let Supervisor Coordinate** - Don't micromanage
4. **Clear Communication** - Specific requests get better results
5. **Celebrate Wins** - Each checkpoint is progress

---

**Remember**: You're orchestrating, not doing. Let the agents work!
