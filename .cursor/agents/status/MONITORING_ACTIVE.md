- Open https://sentry.io
- Look at "Issues" tab
- Any red (critical) issues? Any with 10+ occurrences?

**2. Share with Supervisor** (30 seconds - if issues found):
```
@Supervisor: Sentry daily check - Nov 1

Issues found:
1. "Database timeout on /v1/events" - 12 occurrences
   Link: https://sentry.io/issues/123456

Please analyze and fix.
```

**3. I Fix** (10-30 minutes):
- Analyze error from Sentry details
- Identify root cause
- Implement fix
- Deploy to Railway
- Mark as resolved in Sentry

**4. We Verify** (5 minutes later):
- Check Sentry: New occurrences stopped? ‚úÖ
- Done!

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Backend Sentry Active
From Railway logs:
```
‚úì Sentry initialized (API/ETL)
‚úì Sentry initialized (API/ETL)
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE AND MONITORING**

### Test It Works
You can trigger a test error:
```bash
# Trigger a test exception (will appear in Sentry)
curl -X POST "https://agitracker-production-6efa.up.railway.app/v1/admin/test-sentry" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-admin-key"
```

Check Sentry in 30 seconds - you should see the test error.

## üéØ What to Expect

### Next 24 Hours
- **Sentry captures errors** automatically
- **You check dashboard** once daily (2 min)
- **Share any P1 issues** with Supervisor Agent
- **System self-monitors** otherwise

### Next Week
- **Pattern emerges**: You'll see which errors are common
- **Baseline established**: Know what "normal" looks like
- **Quick fixes**: Share Sentry links, I fix within hours
