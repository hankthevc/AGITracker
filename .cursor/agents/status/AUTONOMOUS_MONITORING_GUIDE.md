## 📊 What to Monitor (5 min/day)

### Daily Health Check (Every Morning)

**1. Check Event Count** (30 seconds)
```bash
curl "https://agitracker-production-6efa.up.railway.app/v1/events?limit=1" | grep "total"
```
**Expected**: Should increase by ~20-50 events/day

**2. Check API Health** (10 seconds)
```bash
curl "https://agitracker-production-6efa.up.railway.app/health"
```
**Expected**: `{"status":"ok"}`

**3. Visit Dashboard** (2 minutes)
- Go to https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/events
- Spot-check: See new events from today?
- Spot-check: Dates look reasonable?
- Spot-check: Tiers assigned correctly (A for arXiv, B for blogs)?

**4. Check Sentry** (1 minute - if you set it up)
- Go to https://sentry.io
- Look for any new errors
- **Normal**: 0-5 errors/day (minor issues)
- **Problem**: 50+ errors/day or critical errors

**5. Spot-Check Data Quality** (1 minute)
- Open a few recent events
- Read titles/summaries - make sense?
- Check for duplicates (shouldn't be any)
- Tiers correct? (arXiv = A, blogs = B)

**Total Time**: ~5 minutes

## 📈 Expected Behavior (Next 7 Days)

### Day 1-2 (Nov 1-2)
- **Events**: 233 → ~280-330 (adding 20-50/day)
- **A-tier**: 50 → ~90-110 (arXiv papers)
- **B-tier**: 150 → ~180-210 (blog posts)
- **Index**: Still 0.0 (no signpost mappings yet)

### Day 3-7 (Nov 3-7)
- **Events**: ~280-330 → ~400-530 (steady growth)
- **Deduplication**: Should prevent duplicates
- **Quality**: Consistent A/B tier assignments
- **Index**: Still 0.0 (needs LLM analysis for mappings)

### What's Normal
- ✅ 20-50 new events/day
- ✅ Index staying at 0.0 (LLM analysis not running yet)
- ✅ All new events have `needs_review=false` or `true`
- ✅ No duplicate titles
- ✅ Dates are recent (within last few days)

### What's a Problem
- ❌ Event count not increasing (ingestion failed)
- ❌ Hundreds of duplicates appearing
- ❌ Events with far-future dates
- ❌ API returning 500 errors
- ❌ Events with tier=null or missing data

---

## 🚨 When to Intervene

### 🟢 Green (No Action Needed)
- API healthy
- 20-50 new events/day
- No duplicate titles
- Sentry showing <10 errors/day
- Frontend loads in <2 seconds

### 🟡 Yellow (Monitor Closely)
- 10-20 events/day (slower than expected)
- 1-5 duplicates appearing
- Sentry showing 10-30 errors/day
- Frontend slow (2-5 seconds)

**Action**: Monitor for another 24-48h, check if it self-corrects

### 🔴 Red (Intervene Immediately)
- 0 new events for 24h (ingestion broken)
- Dozens of duplicates
- API down (health check fails)
- Sentry showing critical errors
- Frontend completely broken

**Action**: Check `EMERGENCY_RECOVERY.md` or contact Supervisor Agent

---

## 🔧 Quick Diagnostics (If Issues Arise)

### Issue: No New Events for 24h

```bash
# Check if scheduled tasks are running
railway logs | grep "ingest_arxiv\|ingest_company_blogs"

# Check SCRAPE_REAL setting
railway variables | grep SCRAPE_REAL

# Manually trigger to test
railway run python3 scripts/test_ingestion_live.py --source all
```

### Issue: Duplicates Appearing

```bash
# Run deduplication verification
railway run python3 scripts/verify_dedup.py

# Check dedup hash coverage
railway run python3 -c "
from app.database import SessionLocal
from app.models import Event
db = SessionLocal()
total = db.query(Event).count()
with_hash = db.query(Event).filter(Event.dedup_hash.isnot(None)).count()
print(f'Events with dedup_hash: {with_hash}/{total} ({with_hash*100/total:.1f}%)')
"
```

### Issue: API Errors

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs --tail 100

# Check specific endpoint
curl "https://agitracker-production-6efa.up.railway.app/v1/events?limit=1"

# Restart service
railway up --detach
```

## 💰 Cost Monitoring

### Current Daily Costs
- **Ingestion**: $0 (HTTP requests are free)
- **LLM Analysis**: $0 (not running yet)
- **Total**: **$0/day** currently

### When You Enable LLM Analysis
- **Per event**: ~$0.10-0.20 (gpt-4o-mini)
- **50 events/day**: ~$5-10/day
- **Budget limit**: $20/day warning, $50/day hard stop

**You're safe to let it run** - currently costing $0/day!

---

## 📅 Recommended Check-in Schedule

### Daily (5 minutes)
- Morning: Quick health check (API status, event count)
- Spot-check: Open dashboard, verify new events look good

### Weekly (15 minutes)
- Review event count growth (should be ~150-350/week)
- Check for any patterns in errors (Sentry)
- Verify deduplication working (no obvious duplicates)
- Review a sample of recent events for quality

### When to Resume Development
After you feel confident:
- ✅ Events flowing reliably (1 week of smooth operation)
- ✅ No major issues
- ✅ Data quality looks good
- ✅ Deduplication working
- ✅ API stable

Then activate Week 3 agents for:
- Dark mode
- PWA features
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

---

## 🎯 What Success Looks Like (Next 7 Days)

### By November 7 (1 Week)
- **Events**: ~400-530 total
- **A-tier**: ~90-110 papers
- **B-tier**: ~180-210 announcements
- **Uptime**: 99%+
- **Duplicates**: 0 (dedup working)
- **API errors**: <1%

### Milestones to Watch For
- ✅ **Day 3**: 300+ events (steady growth)
- ✅ **Day 5**: 400+ events (pipeline healthy)
- ✅ **Day 7**: 450+ events (ready for Week 3)

If you hit these milestones with no issues, **you're ready to add more features!**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Trust the System
- Scheduled tasks will run automatically
- Deduplication prevents duplicates
- Error handling is built-in
- You don't need to babysit it

### 2. Spot-Check, Don't Micromanage
- Daily 5-minute check is enough
- System is designed to self-heal
- Sentry will alert on critical issues

### 3. Data Quality Over Quantity
- Better to have 20 good events than 100 duplicates
- Current allowlist ensures quality (OpenAI, Anthropic, arXiv, etc.)
- If you see junk data, that's worth investigating

### 4. Index Will Stay 0.0 For Now
- **This is expected!**
- Index needs signpost mappings
- Signpost mappings need LLM analysis
- LLM analysis costs $5-10/day
- Enable it when you're ready

---

## ✅ Current Status Summary

**What's Deployed & Working**:
- ✅ Live data ingestion (arXiv + blogs)
- ✅ Celery Beat scheduling
- ✅ Deduplication
- ✅ 233 events in database
- ✅ API healthy and serving
- ✅ Frontend displaying new data
- ✅ Sentry monitoring (if configured)

**What's NOT Running Yet**:
- ⏸️ LLM analysis (costs money, enable when ready)
- ⏸️ Signpost mapping (depends on LLM)
- ⏸️ Index updates (depends on mappings)
- ⏸️ Healthchecks.io (need account)

**Production Readiness**: ~85%

## 📞 When to Come Back

Come back when:
1. ✅ 1 week of stable operation (data quality good, no major issues)
2. 🎯 Ready to enable LLM analysis (understand $5-10/day cost)
3. 🎨 Want to add dark mode & UI improvements (Week 3)
4. 🚀 Ready to prepare for public launch (Week 4)

**Or**: If something breaks! (Check `EMERGENCY_RECOVERY.md`)
