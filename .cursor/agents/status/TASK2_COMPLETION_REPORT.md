# Task 2 Completion Report: Configure Celery Beat Scheduling

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Agent**: Backend Agent  
**Task**: Configure Celery Beat Scheduling (Week 2, Priority 2)  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Time**: 1 hour (under 4-6 hour estimate)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully verified and enhanced Celery Beat scheduling for automated daily ingestion. The system has **22 scheduled tasks** configured across news ingestion, benchmark fetching, event processing, and daily snapshots. Added **healthcheck pings** to critical tasks for monitoring.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Celery Beat Schedule Verified ✅

The existing Celery Beat configuration in `services/etl/app/celery_app.py` was reviewed and found to be comprehensive:

**News Ingestion (7 tasks)**:
- Company blogs: Twice daily (5:15 AM & 5:15 PM UTC) - B-tier
- arXiv papers: Twice daily (5:35 AM & 5:35 PM UTC) - A-tier  
- Press (Reuters/AP): Twice daily (6:15 AM & 6:15 PM UTC) - C-tier
- Social media: Once daily (5:55 AM UTC) - D-tier

**Event Processing (4 tasks)**:
- Event mapping: Twice daily (6:30 AM & 6:30 PM UTC)
- Event analysis (LLM): Twice daily (7:00 AM & 7:00 PM UTC)

**Benchmark Fetching (6 tasks)**:
- Daily benchmark scraping: 7:12 AM - 8:02 AM UTC
- Sources: SWE-bench, OSWorld, WebArena, GPQA, HLE

**Daily/Weekly Tasks (5 tasks)**:
- Daily index snapshot: 8:05 AM UTC
- Source credibility: 9:00 AM UTC  
- Weekly digest: Sunday 8:08 AM UTC
- Security maturity: Monday 8:32 AM UTC

**Total**: **22 scheduled tasks** running automatically

### 2. Healthcheck Integration Added ✅

Added healthcheck pings to critical ingestion tasks using the existing `ping_healthcheck_url` utility:

**Modified Files**:

1. **`services/etl/app/tasks/news/ingest_arxiv.py`**
   - ✅ Success ping with metadata (new_events, skipped, errors)
   - ✅ Failure ping with error message
   - ✅ Uses `settings.healthcheck_feeds_url`

2. **`services/etl/app/tasks/news/ingest_company_blogs.py`**
   - ✅ Success ping with metadata
   - ✅ Failure ping with error message
   - ✅ Uses `settings.healthcheck_feeds_url`

3. **`services/etl/app/tasks/analyze/generate_event_analysis.py`**
   - ✅ Success ping with LLM budget tracking
   - ✅ Failure ping with error message
   - ✅ Uses `settings.healthcheck_index_url`

**Healthcheck Metadata Sent**:
```json
{
  "connector": "ingest_arxiv",
  "new_events": 15,
  "skipped": 3,
  "errors": 0
}
```

### 3. Monitoring Script Created ✅

Created `scripts/monitor_celery_tasks.py` - a comprehensive monitoring tool:

**Features**:
- ✅ Show active (running) tasks
- ✅ Show scheduled (upcoming) tasks
- ✅ Display full Beat schedule configuration
- ✅ Worker statistics and registered tasks
- ✅ Production command reference

**Usage**:
```bash
python scripts/monitor_celery_tasks.py --mode schedule  # Show beat schedule
python scripts/monitor_celery_tasks.py --mode active    # Show running tasks
python scripts/monitor_celery_tasks.py --mode all       # Show everything
```

## Celery Beat Schedule Overview

### Morning Ingestion Wave (5:15 AM - 6:30 AM UTC)

```
05:15 UTC - Company blogs ingestion (B-tier)
05:35 UTC - arXiv papers ingestion (A-tier)
05:55 UTC - Social media ingestion (D-tier)
06:03 UTC - Feed aggregation
06:15 UTC - Press (Reuters/AP) ingestion (C-tier)
06:30 UTC - Event mapping to signposts
```

### Morning Analysis Wave (7:00 AM - 9:00 AM UTC)

```

18:15 UTC - Press ingestion (evening)
18:30 UTC - Event mapping (evening)
19:00 UTC - Event analysis (evening)
```

## Healthchecks.io Integration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Main feeds healthcheck (ingestion tasks)
HEALTHCHECK_FEEDS_URL=https://hc-ping.com/YOUR-UUID-HERE

# Index/analysis healthcheck (processing tasks)
HEALTHCHECK_INDEX_URL=https://hc-ping.com/YOUR-UUID-HERE

# Leaderboard healthcheck (benchmark tasks)
HEALTHCHECK_LEADERBOARDS_URL=https://hc-ping.com/YOUR-UUID-HERE

# Weekly digest healthcheck
HEALTHCHECK_DIGEST_URL=https://hc-ping.com/YOUR-UUID-HERE
```

### Healthcheck Behavior

**On Success**:
- HTTP GET/POST to healthcheck URL
- Sends metadata as JSON body
- Logs success to Sentry

**On Failure**:
- HTTP GET/POST to `{URL}/fail`
- Sends error message (truncated to 200 chars)
- Logs failure to Sentry
- Does NOT raise exception (healthcheck failures don't break tasks)

---

## Production Deployment Guide

### 1. Verify Environment Variables

```bash
# On Railway
railway variables set HEALTHCHECK_FEEDS_URL=https://hc-ping.com/...
railway variables set HEALTHCHECK_INDEX_URL=https://hc-ping.com/...
railway variables set HEALTHCHECK_LEADERBOARDS_URL=https://hc-ping.com/...
railway variables set HEALTHCHECK_DIGEST_URL=https://hc-ping.com/...
```

### 2. Deploy Services

Railway should have two services:
- **celery-worker**: Executes tasks
- **celery-beat**: Schedules tasks

**Verify deployment**:
```bash
# Check Beat is running
railway logs --service celery-beat | grep "beat"

# Check scheduled tasks
railway run celery -A app.celery_app inspect scheduled

# Check active tasks
railway run celery -A app.celery_app inspect active
```

### 3. Monitor Healthchecks

On Healthchecks.io dashboard:
- ✅ Green: Task ran successfully within expected interval
- ⚠️ Yellow: Task is late (hasn't pinged)
- ❌ Red: Task failed (pinged `/fail` endpoint)

### 4. Verify First Runs

After deployment, wait for scheduled tasks:
- **5:15 AM UTC**: First company blogs ingestion
- **5:35 AM UTC**: First arXiv ingestion
- **7:00 AM UTC**: First event analysis

Check Railway logs:
```bash
railway logs --service celery-worker --since 1h
```

---

## Testing Locally

### Start Redis (required for Celery)

```bash
# macOS
brew services start redis

# Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
```

### Start Celery Worker

```bash
cd services/etl
celery -A app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

### Start Celery Beat (in separate terminal)

```bash
cd services/etl
celery -A app.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
```

### Monitor Tasks

```bash
# Show beat schedule
python scripts/monitor_celery_tasks.py --mode schedule

# Show active tasks
python scripts/monitor_celery_tasks.py --mode active

# Show all
python scripts/monitor_celery_tasks.py --mode all
```

### Manually Trigger a Task

```bash
cd services/etl
celery -A app.celery_app call ingest_arxiv
celery -A app.celery_app call ingest_company_blogs
celery -A app.celery_app call generate_event_analysis
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Beat schedule not running | Railway service monitoring + healthchecks | ✅ |
| Task failures | Healthcheck `/fail` pings + Sentry alerts | ✅ |
| Time zone issues | All times UTC, clearly documented | ✅ |
| Resource contention | Tasks staggered 3-15 min apart | ✅ |
| Task timeouts | 30-min hard limit configured | ✅ |

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Production)

1. **Deploy to Railway**:
   - ✅ Code already deployed (automatic via git push)
   - ⏳ Set healthcheck environment variables
   - ⏳ Verify celery-beat service is running
   - ⏳ Monitor first scheduled run

2. **Configure Healthchecks.io**:
   - Create 4 checks (feeds, index, leaderboards, digest)
   - Set expected intervals (12h for feeds, 24h for index, etc.)
   - Add notification channels (email, Slack)

3. **Monitor First 24 Hours**:
   - Watch Railway logs for scheduled tasks
   - Verify healthchecks are pinging
   - Check database for new events
   - Review LLM budget spend

### Task 3 (Next)

Ready to proceed with **Task 3: LLM Budget Management**:
- Verify budget tracking with real usage
- Test $20 warning threshold
- Test $50 hard limit
- Add budget monitoring dashboard

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Beat Not Scheduling Tasks

```bash
# Check if beat service is running
railway logs --service celery-beat | grep "Scheduler"

# Restart beat
railway restart --service celery-beat

# Verify beat schedule
railway run celery -A app.celery_app inspect scheduled
```

### Tasks Not Executing

```bash
# Check worker is running
railway logs --service celery-worker | grep "ready"

# Check for errors
railway logs --service celery-worker --since 1h | grep ERROR

# Check registered tasks
railway run celery -A app.celery_app inspect registered
```

### Healthchecks Not Pinging

```bash
# Verify environment variables set
railway variables | grep HEALTHCHECK

# Check task logs for ping attempts
railway logs --service celery-worker | grep "healthcheck"

# Test healthcheck URL manually
curl https://hc-ping.com/YOUR-UUID
```
