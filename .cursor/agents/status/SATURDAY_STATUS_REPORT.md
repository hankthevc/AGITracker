## 🔧 Issue Identified: Celery Beat Not Running

### Root Cause
Railway is only starting the **web server** (FastAPI), not the **scheduler** (Celery Beat).

**Current setup**:
```bash
# What's running
uvicorn app.main:app  # ✅ Web server

# What's NOT running  
celery beat  # ❌ Scheduler (triggers automatic ingestion)
```

### Fix Deployed
I just updated `railway.json` to start Celery Beat alongside the web server:

**Before**:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app
```

**After**:
```bash
celery beat &  # Start scheduler in background
uvicorn app.main:app  # Start web server
```

**Status**: ✅ Fix committed and deployed (commit `485339f`)

### Verification Pending
Need to check Railway logs for:
```
celery beat v5.x.x is starting
```

If Celery Beat starts successfully, automatic ingestion will run at:
- **Today 9:15 PM** (5:15 AM UTC Sunday) - Next scheduled run
- **Tomorrow 9:30 PM** (5:30 AM UTC Monday) - arXiv papers

---

## 📈 Expected Behavior (Next 48 Hours)

### If Celery Beat is Running
**Tomorrow (Sunday)**:
- Events: 233 → ~270-280 (+40-50 new)
- New arXiv papers from Oct 31-Nov 1
- New blog posts from Friday-Saturday

**Monday**:
- Events: ~270 → ~310-330 (+40-50 more)
- Daily growth pattern established

### If Celery Beat is NOT Running Yet
- Events stay at 233
- No automatic ingestion
- Need to investigate Celery Beat setup further

## 🎯 What to Do Now

### 1. Mark Test Events as Resolved (30 seconds)
In Sentry:
- Click first test event → "Resolve" button
- Click second test event → "Resolve" button
- This clears them from your "Unresolved" queue

### 2. Check Tomorrow (Sunday Evening)
Around 9:30 PM Pacific (after 5:15 AM UTC scheduled run):

**Visit your dashboard**:
- Go to https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/events
- Count should be ~270-280 (vs 233 today)
- Should see papers dated "Oct 31" or "Nov 1"

**If count increased** → ✅ Celery Beat working, autonomous operation confirmed!  
**If count still 233** → ⚠️ Ping me, we'll troubleshoot Celery Beat

### 3. Check Sentry (Monday Morning)
- Should still show 0 errors (or just minor noise)
- If errors appear → Share with me
