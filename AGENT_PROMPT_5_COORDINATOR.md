# Mission: Master Coordinator - Merge All Agent Work

You are the **Master Coordinator Agent** responsible for merging all parallel agent work into one cohesive PR and creating a consolidated human intervention checklist.

## Context

Four agents are working in parallel on different aspects of the AGI Signpost Tracker:
- **Agent 1 (DevOps)**: CI/CD pipeline, deployment automation
- **Agent 2 (Features)**: Phase 3 features, code audits  
- **Agent 3 (AI/ML)**: Phase 4 RAG features, architecture audits
- **Agent 4 (Docs)**: Documentation site, user guides

**Your job**: Merge all their work, resolve conflicts, create unified PR, and identify what needs human review.

## Prerequisites

**Before you start, verify all agents have completed their work:**

- [ ] Agent 1 branch exists: `feature/devops-automation`
- [ ] Agent 2 branch exists: `feature/phase-3-features`
- [ ] Agent 3 branch exists: `feature/phase-4-rag`
- [ ] Agent 4 branch exists: `feature/docs-site`

**Read these files FIRST**:
1. `AGENT_MERGE_COORDINATION.md` - Conflict resolution strategy
2. `DOCUMENTATION_SPRINT_COMPLETE.md` - Agent 4's work summary
3. All `AGENT_PROMPT_*.md` files to understand what each agent built

## Your Tasks

```

#### 1.2 Identify Conflicts

Check for conflicts in these HIGH-RISK files:
- `README.md` - All 4 agents modified
- `services/etl/app/main.py` - Agents 2 & 3 added endpoints
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Agents 1 & 4 modified
- User guides - Check for duplicates

### Phase 2: Merge Strategy (2-3 hours)

#### 2.1 Create Merge Branch

```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create unified merge branch
git checkout -b feature/unified-all-agents

# Merge in recommended order (per AGENT_MERGE_COORDINATION.md)
git merge feature/docs-site          # Agent 4 first (foundation)
git merge feature/devops-automation  # Agent 1 second (CI/CD)
git merge feature/phase-3-features   # Agent 2 third
git merge feature/phase-4-rag        # Agent 3 last
```

#### 2.2 Resolve Conflicts

For each conflict:

1. **README.md conflicts**:
   - Use section markers from `AGENT_MERGE_COORDINATION.md`
   - Ensure each agent's content is in their designated section
   - Verify order: Badges â†’ Docs â†’ Features â†’ Rest of content

2. **main.py conflicts**:
   - Keep all endpoints
   - Organize by phase with clear comments:
     ```python
     # ===== Phase 3 Endpoints (Agent 2) =====
     # ===== Phase 4 Endpoints (Agent 3) =====
     ```
   - Verify no duplicate route definitions

3. **CONTRIBUTING.md conflicts**:
   - Merge both sections (Agent 1's CI/CD + Agent 4's PR examples)
   - Create cohesive structure

4. **Duplicate guides**:
   - If Agents 2 & 3 created guides that Agent 4 already has:
     - Keep Agent 4's Docusaurus versions
     - Extract any unique technical details from Agent 2/3 versions
     - Merge those details into Agent 4's guides
     - Delete duplicate files

#### 2.3 Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Backend tests
cd services/etl
pytest

# Frontend tests  
cd ../../apps/web
npm test

# E2E tests (if Agent 1 set them up)
npm run e2e

# Build checks
npm run build
cd ../../services/etl
python -m py_compile app/main.py

# Lint checks
cd ../../
npm run lint
cd services/etl
ruff check .
```

Document all test failures in `MERGE_TEST_RESULTS.md`.

### Phase 3: Consolidation (2-3 hours)

#### 3.1 Unify Documentation

**Create unified docs structure**:

```bash
# Move all docs to Docusaurus
mv docs/dependency-audit.md docs-site/docs/deployment/dependency-audit.md
mv docs/frontend-code-audit.md docs-site/docs/architecture/frontend-code-audit.md
mv docs/backend-code-audit.md docs-site/docs/architecture/backend-code-audit.md
mv docs/database-schema-audit.md docs-site/docs/architecture/database-schema-audit.md
mv docs/architecture-review.md docs-site/docs/architecture/architecture-review.md
mv docs/security-architecture-review.md docs-site/docs/architecture/security-architecture-review.md
mv docs/llm-architecture-review.md docs-site/docs/architecture/llm-architecture-review.md
mv docs/frontend-architecture-review.md docs-site/docs/architecture/frontend-architecture-review.md
mv docs/ci-cd.md docs-site/docs/deployment/ci-cd.md

# Update Docusaurus sidebars to include new docs
```

**Update `docs-site/sidebars.ts`**:
```typescript
architectureSidebar: [
  'architecture/overview',
  'architecture/frontend',
  'architecture/backend', 
  'architecture/database',
  {
    type: 'category',
    label: 'Code Audits',
    items: [
      'architecture/frontend-code-audit',
      'architecture/backend-code-audit',
      'architecture/database-schema-audit',
    ],
  },
  {
    type: 'category',
    label: 'System Reviews',
    items: [
      'architecture/architecture-review',
      'architecture/security-architecture-review',
      'architecture/llm-architecture-review',
      'architecture/frontend-architecture-review',
    ],
  },
],

deploymentSidebar: [
  'deployment/vercel',
  'deployment/railway',
  'deployment/production',
  'deployment/ci-cd',
  'deployment/dependency-audit',
],
```

#### 3.2 Create Unified README

Ensure README.md has all sections in this order:

```markdown
# AGI Signpost Tracker

[![License: CC BY 4.0](...)

[Status badges from Agent 1]

**Evidence-first dashboard tracking proximity to AGI via measurable signposts**

## ðŸ“– Documentation

[Agent 4's documentation links]

## Features

[Combined Phase 3 & 4 features from Agents 2 & 3]

## Vision & Approach

[Existing content - don't modify]

[... rest of existing README ...]
```

#### 3.3 Create Master CHANGELOG Entry

Add to CHANGELOG.md:

```markdown

```

Document findings in `SECURITY_SCAN_RESULTS.md`.

### Phase 5: Human Intervention Checklist (1 hour)

#### 5.1 Create HUMAN_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED.md

**File**: `HUMAN_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED.md`

Document everything that needs human review/approval:

```markdown
# Human Intervention Required - Consolidated Checklist

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Must Review Before Merge

### 1. Environment Variables & Secrets

**Action Required**: Set these in production environments

#### Vercel (Frontend)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Production API URL
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` - Frontend error tracking
- [ ] Verify domain: docs.agi-tracker.vercel.app

#### Railway (Backend)
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - Production PostgreSQL with pgvector
- [ ] `REDIS_URL` - Production Redis
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For RAG chatbot & embeddings (Agent 3)
- [ ] `API_KEY` - Admin key (rotate from dev value!)
- [ ] `SENTRY_DSN` - Backend error tracking
- [ ] `HEALTHCHECKS_URL` - Uptime monitoring

#### GitHub Secrets (CI/CD)
- [ ] `VERCEL_TOKEN` - For deployment workflow
- [ ] `RAILWAY_TOKEN` - For deployment workflow
- [ ] `ADMIN_API_KEY` - For E2E tests

### 2. Database Migrations

**Action Required**: Run migrations in production

```bash
# Connect to production database
railway connect postgres

# Run migrations (check which ones are new)
cd infra/migrations
alembic current  # Check current version
alembic history  # See all migrations
alembic upgrade head  # Apply new migrations
```

**New migrations to apply** (verify which exist):
- [ ] Migration XXX: Vector embeddings columns (Agent 3)
- [ ] Migration XXX: [Any other new migrations]

### 3. Cost Implications - Review & Approve

#### OpenAI API Costs (Agent 3's features)
- **Vector Embeddings**: ~$0.13 per 1M tokens (text-embedding-3-small)
  - Estimate: 1,000 events Ã— 500 tokens = 500k tokens = **~$0.07 one-time**
  - Ongoing: ~100 new events/month = **~$0.01/month**

- **RAG Chatbot**: GPT-4o-mini at ~$0.15 per 1M input tokens
  - Estimate: 1,000 queries/month Ã— 2k tokens = 2M tokens = **~$0.30/month**
  
- **Total new LLM costs**: **~$0.31/month** (very low)

**Decision needed**: 
- [ ] Approve additional $0.31/month OpenAI spend
- [ ] Or disable Agent 3 features (RAG chatbot, vector search)

#### Infrastructure Costs
- **Existing**: ~$25/month (Railway + Redis)
- **New**: No additional infrastructure needed
- **Total**: Still ~$25/month âœ…

### 4. Feature Flags - Enable/Disable

**Action Required**: Decide which features to enable

Create `services/etl/app/config.py` feature flags:

```python
# Feature flags (set via environment variables)
ENABLE_RAG_CHATBOT = os.getenv("ENABLE_RAG_CHATBOT", "false").lower() == "true"
ENABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH = os.getenv("ENABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH", "false").lower() == "true"
ENABLE_SCENARIO_EXPLORER = os.getenv("ENABLE_SCENARIO_EXPLORER", "true").lower() == "true"
```

**Recommendations**:
- [ ] Phase 3 features (Agent 2): **Enable all** (no cost, high value)
- [ ] Scenario explorer (Agent 3): **Enable** (no cost, high value)
- [ ] RAG chatbot (Agent 3): **Enable if budget allows** (+$0.30/month)
- [ ] Vector search (Agent 3): **Enable if budget allows** (+$0.01/month)

### 5. Breaking Changes - Review Impact

**Potential breaking changes**:

- [ ] **API endpoint changes**: Review if any existing endpoints changed
- [ ] **Database schema**: Check if any columns renamed/removed
- [ ] **Environment variables**: Verify .env.example matches production needs
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Check if any major version bumps

**Action**: Test against existing integrations (if any).

### 6. Security Review

**Action Required**: Review security findings

From `docs-site/docs/architecture/security-architecture-review.md` (Agent 3):
- [ ] Review top 10 security findings
- [ ] Decide which to fix pre-launch vs post-launch
- [ ] Verify API key rotation happened (change from `dev-key-change-in-production`)

From `docs/dependency-audit.md` (Agent 1):
- [ ] Review critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Apply patches or accept risk
- [ ] Document decisions

### 7. Code Quality - Review Audits

**Action Required**: Review and prioritize fixes

From Agent 2's code audits:
- [ ] `docs-site/docs/architecture/frontend-code-audit.md`
- [ ] `docs-site/docs/architecture/backend-code-audit.md`
- [ ] `docs-site/docs/architecture/database-schema-audit.md`

**Questions to answer**:
- Which issues are blocking (must fix pre-merge)?
- Which are nice-to-have (create issues for later)?
- Any false positives to dismiss?

### 8. Deployment Checklist

**Action Required**: Follow deployment sequence

#### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Merge this PR to main
- [ ] Verify all CI checks pass
- [ ] Create backup of production database

#### Deployment Sequence  
1. [ ] Deploy backend to Railway (triggers migration)

5. [ ] Run smoke tests on production

#### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Test all new features in production
- [ ] Monitor error rates in Sentry
- [ ] Check API response times
- [ ] Verify Celery workers running (Agent 1's work)

### 9. Documentation Deployment

**Action Required**: Deploy Docusaurus site

```bash
cd docs-site

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] Site accessible at docs.agi-tracker.vercel.app
- [ ] All pages load

```

#### 5.2 Create Issues for Follow-Up Work

**For each item that doesn't need immediate fixing**:

Create GitHub issues with:
- Title: `[Post-Launch] Fix XYZ`
- Label: `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`, etc.
- Priority: P0/P1/P2
- Assigned to: Appropriate person
- References: Link to audit document

Example:
```markdown
Title: [Post-Launch] Fix N+1 queries in /v1/events endpoint

Description:
From backend-code-audit.md, line 143:
