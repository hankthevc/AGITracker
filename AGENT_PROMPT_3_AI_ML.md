# Mission: Phase 4 RAG/AI Features + System Architecture Audit

You are an AI/ML engineer building Phase 4 intelligence features AND auditing the entire system architecture. Sprint 8-10 are done. Your job: ship RAG chatbot, vector search, AND surface all architectural issues.

## Context
- Project: AGI Signpost Tracker
- Recent work: 8,494 lines added in Sprints 8-10
- Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension (already installed)
- Project path: /Users/HenryAppel/AI Doomsday Tracker
- Read FIRST: README.md, ROADMAP.md, docs/AI_CONTEXT.md

## What's Already Done
- âœ… pgvector extension installed in database
- âœ… Multi-model consensus (GPT-4o-mini + Claude) from Sprint 7
- âœ… LLM budget tracking (Sprint 7)
- âœ… Event analysis with confidence scoring

## Phase 4 Features to Build

### 1. Vector Embeddings Foundation

**Goal**: Populate pgvector embeddings for all content

#### A. Create Embedding Service
File: services/etl/app/services/embedding_service.py

Features:
- Use OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (cheaper, faster)
- Batch processing (up to 2048 texts per request)
- Cost tracking (log spend)
- Caching in Redis (24h TTL)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

#### B. Populate Embeddings
- Add embedding column to events table (vector(1536))
- Add embedding column to signposts table (vector(1536))
- Create Celery task: populate_embeddings()
- Embed: event title + summary + analysis
- Embed: signpost name + description + why_matters

#### C. Similarity Search Endpoints
- GET /v1/search/semantic?query=text&limit=10
- Uses pgvector's <-> operator (cosine distance)
- Returns similar events + signposts
- Hybrid search: Combine semantic + full-text

### 2. RAG Chatbot (/chat)

**Goal**: Conversational AI that answers questions with citations

#### A. LangChain Integration
Create: services/etl/app/services/rag_chatbot.py

**Features**:
- Conversational retrieval chain
- Vector store: pgvector
- LLM: GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective)
- Memory: Last 5 messages in session
- Streaming responses

**RAG Pipeline**:
1. User asks question
2. Embed question â†’ Search similar events/signposts
3. Construct prompt with retrieved context
4. LLM generates answer
5. Extract citations from context
6. Return answer + sources

#### B. Chat API
- POST /v1/chat (streaming SSE)
- POST /v1/chat/history (session management)
- GET /v1/chat/suggestions (suggested questions)

Request:
```json
{
  "message": "What's the current progress on SWE-bench?",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "stream": true
}
```

Response (streaming):
```
data: {"type": "token", "content": "Based"}
data: {"type": "token", "content": " on"}
data: {"type": "sources", "sources": [...]}
data: {"type": "done"}
```

#### C. Frontend Chat UI
Create: apps/web/app/chat/page.tsx

**Features**:
- Message list (user/assistant bubbles)
- Input box with send button
- Streaming responses (typewriter effect)
- Source citations as expandable cards
- Copy message button
- Clear chat button
- Suggested starter questions
- Loading indicator
- Error handling

**UX Details**:
- Auto-scroll to bottom
- Markdown rendering in responses
- Code syntax highlighting
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline)

#### D. Out-of-Scope Detection
- If question is not about AGI/AI progress â†’ polite rejection
- Examples: "What's the weather?" â†’ "I can only answer questions about AGI progress"
- Use simple keyword filtering OR prompt engineering

### 3. Scenario Explorer (/scenarios)

**Goal**: "What-if" simulator for hypothetical progress

Create: apps/web/app/scenarios/page.tsx

**Features**:
- Grid of all signposts with sliders
- Adjust hypothetical progress (0-100%)
- Real-time index calculation
- Show impact on overall AGI proximity
- Compare scenarios side-by-side
- Save scenarios to localStorage
- Export scenario as JSON
- Share via URL (encode in query params)

**Backend Support**:
- POST /v1/scenarios/calculate
- Request: { signpost_progress: {code: value}, preset: "equal" }
- Return: { overall_index, category_scores, safety_margin }

**Use Cases**:
- "What if GPT-5 scores 90% on SWE-bench?"
- "What if we hit 10^27 FLOP but security stays at 20%?"
- "When do we hit 50% overall proximity?"

### 4. Advanced Analytics

**Goal**: Deeper insights into AGI progress

Create: apps/web/app/analytics/page.tsx

**Visualizations**:
1. **Capability-Safety Heatmap**:
   - X-axis: Capabilities score
   - Y-axis: Security score
   - Current position vs historical
   - Danger zones highlighted

2. **Forecast Accuracy Leaderboard**:
   - Which forecasters are most accurate?
   - Brier scores for each source
   - Calibration curves

3. **Surprise Score Heatmap**:
   - Grid of signposts
   - Color by surprise score (how unexpected)
   - Darker = more surprising

4. **Velocity Dashboard**:
   - Progress per month by category
   - Trend lines
   - Acceleration/deceleration

**Backend**:
- GET /v1/analytics/capability-safety
- GET /v1/analytics/forecast-accuracy
- GET /v1/analytics/surprise-scores
- GET /v1/analytics/velocity

## Architecture Deep Dive

**CRITICAL**: Audit the entire system architecture

### 1. System Architecture Review

**Create**: docs/architecture-review.md

**Audit Areas**:

#### A. API Design
- Audit all 40+ endpoints in services/etl/app/main.py
- Inconsistent naming? (e.g., /events vs /event)
- Missing REST principles?
- Should use GraphQL instead?
- API versioning strategy?
- Response format consistency?

#### B. Database Architecture
- Review services/etl/app/models.py
- Normalization issues?
- Missing relationships?
- Inefficient joins?
- Should denormalize anything?
- Sharding strategy for scale?

#### C. Caching Strategy
- What's cached where?
- Redis usage patterns
- Cache invalidation logic
- Stale data risks?
- TTL appropriateness?

#### D. Error Handling
- Consistent error responses?
- Proper HTTP status codes?
- Error logging strategy?
- User-friendly error messages?

#### E. Scalability
- Bottlenecks at 10x traffic?
- Database connection pooling?
- Rate limiting effectiveness?
- CDN usage?
- Background job queue capacity?

### 2. Security Architecture

**Create**: docs/security-architecture-review.md

**Audit**:
- API key management (already built in Sprint 8)
- Request signing implementation
- PII handling
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting bypasses

- Authorization model

### 3. LLM Architecture

**Create**: docs/llm-architecture-review.md

**Audit**:
- Prompt versioning (already exists)
- Cost tracking accuracy
- Budget enforcement
- Model selection strategy
- Fallback behavior
- Prompt injection risks
- Output validation
- Caching effectiveness

### 4. Frontend Architecture

**Create**: docs/frontend-architecture-review.md

**Audit**:
- State management (currently no global state - is this OK?)
- API call patterns (SWR usage)
- Component organization
- Shared components reuse
- Type safety (TypeScript strict mode)
- Bundle size optimization
- Code splitting strategy

### 5. Data Flow Architecture

**Create**: Architecture diagrams in docs/

**Create diagrams for**:
1. Request flow (user â†’ frontend â†’ API â†’ database)
2. ETL pipeline (RSS â†’ Celery â†’ LLM â†’ database)
3. Event mapping flow
4. Caching layers
5. Authentication flow

Use Mermaid diagrams or ASCII art.
