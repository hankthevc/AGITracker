## 🚀 Sprint 9: Performance & Scale (Ready)

Sprint 9 is now planned and ready for execution!

**Prompt**: `AGENT_PROMPT_SPRINT_9.md` (created and pushed to main)  
**Estimated Time**: 5-8 hours  
**Cost**: $0 (no additional infrastructure)

### Tasks Overview

#### Task 9.1: Database Query Optimization
**Goal**: Ensure <100ms query times as data scales to 10,000+ events

**Subtasks:**
1. Run performance audit (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
2. Create performance indexes migration
   - Composite indexes for common queries
   - Full-text search preparation
   - Event and signpost link optimizations
3. Optimize cache TTLs
4. Implement cursor-based pagination
