# Railway Celery Workers Deployment Script
# ========================================================
# 
# This script automates the deployment of Celery workers
# and beat scheduler to Railway.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Railway CLI installed (https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli)
# 2. Railway account with project created
# 3. Environment variables configured
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/deploy-celery-railway.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run    Show what would be deployed without executing
