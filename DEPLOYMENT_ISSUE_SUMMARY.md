# Sprint 9/10 Deployment Issue - Summary and Next Steps

## Problem
The news and events pages are broken due to Railway backend API returning HTTP 500 errors on `/v1/events` endpoint.

## Root Cause
Sprint 9 and 10 added database schema changes (migrations 018 and 019) that haven't been applied to the Railway production database. The API code references these new columns/indexes, causing SQL errors.

## What I've Done

### 1. Frontend Fixes (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
- **Commit 13e8c00**: Separated Navigation into client component to restore metadata
  - Fixed layout.tsx being a client component (breaks metadata export)
  - Created Navigation.tsx and KeyboardShortcutsProvider.tsx
  
### 2. Backend Code Fixes (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
- **Commit 68d8b81**: Made significance filter truly optional
  - Fixed EventAnalysis join only happening when filter is used
- **Commit df2fe46**: Added automatic migrations to start_server.py
  - Dockerfile now copies migrations and alembic.ini
  - start_server.py runs `alembic upgrade head` before starting API
- **Commit 1e8d10d**: Configured alembic for Railway environment
  - Removed hardcoded database URL
  - Updated env.py to work in Docker container
- **Commit b322894**: Added detailed logging to diagnose issues

### 3. Documentation Created
- `RAILWAY_MIGRATION_FIX_NEEDED.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Status tracking
- This summary document

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è STILL FAILING

Even after 4 deployment attempts, the API continues to return 500 errors. The automatic migration approach isn't working yet.

## Why It's Still Failing

Possible reasons:
1. **Alembic not finding models** - Path issues in Docker container
2. **DATABASE_URL format** - Railway might use different format than expected
3. **Missing Python dependencies** - Alembic might not be installed in production
4. **Permission issues** - Database user might not have DDL privileges
5. **Migration already partially applied** - Alembic state might be inconsistent

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Check Railway Logs (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to Railway dashboard for the AGI Tracker project
2. Click on the API service deployment
3. View the logs for the latest deployment
4. Look for:
   ```
   üîÑ Running database migrations...
   DATABASE_URL present: True
   ```
5. Share any errors from the migration section

### Option 2: Manual Migration via Railway CLI
If you have Railway CLI authenticated:
```bash
railway link  # Link to your project
railway run alembic -c infra/migrations/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

### Option 3: Direct Database Connection
1. Get DATABASE_URL from Railway dashboard
2. Run migrations locally:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
cd infra/migrations
alembic upgrade head
```

### Option 4: Railway Shell Access
If Railway provides shell access:
```bash
railway shell
cd /app/migrations
alembic -c /app/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

## Migrations That Need to Be Applied

### Migration 018 (Sprint 9 - Performance)
```sql
-- 13 indexes for query optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_events_tier_published ON events(evidence_tier, published_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_published_id ON events(published_at DESC, id DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_title_fts ON events USING gin(to_tsvector('english', title));
-- ... and 10 more indexes
```

### Migration 019 (Sprint 10 - URL Validation)
```sql
-- 4 new columns for URL validation
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN url_validated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN url_status_code INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN url_is_valid BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN url_error TEXT;
-- Plus 2 indexes
```

## Alternative: Rollback Approach

If migrations can't be applied quickly, we could:
1. Temporarily remove Sprint 9/10 code changes
2. Deploy a working version without new features
3. Apply migrations manually when Railway access is available
4. Redeploy with Sprint 9/10 features

This would require:
```bash
git revert b322894^..df2fe46  # Revert migration-related commits
git push origin main
```

## Testing After Fix

Once migrations are applied:
```bash
# Test API
curl "https://agitracker-production-6efa.up.railway.app/v1/events?limit=2"

# Should return JSON like:
# {"total": 2, "results": [...], "has_more": true, "next_cursor": "..."}
```

Frontend should work:

- https://agi-tracker.vercel.app/events ‚úÖ

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `/workspace/Dockerfile` - Added migrations to container
- `/workspace/services/etl/start_server.py` - Auto-run migrations
- `/workspace/services/etl/app/main.py` - Fixed significance filter join
- `/workspace/infra/migrations/env.py` - Docker path handling
- `/workspace/infra/migrations/alembic.ini` - Removed hardcoded URL

### Frontend
- `/workspace/apps/web/app/layout.tsx` - Server component with metadata
- `/workspace/apps/web/components/Navigation.tsx` - New client component
- `/workspace/apps/web/components/KeyboardShortcutsProvider.tsx` - New

### Migrations (Already Exist)
- `/workspace/infra/migrations/versions/018_add_performance_indexes.py`
- `/workspace/infra/migrations/versions/019_add_url_validation.py`

## Summary

**Problem**: Database migrations not applied on Railway  
**Attempted Fix**: Automatic migrations in Docker startup  
**Status**: Not working yet, needs Railway logs to debug  
**Next Step**: You need to check Railway logs or manually run migrations

All code is pushed to main. The automatic migration approach *should* work, but something in the Railway environment is preventing it. The detailed logging I added will show exactly what's failing in the Railway dashboard.
