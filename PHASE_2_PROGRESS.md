  * get_surprises(): Returns top N most surprising events
  * get_prediction_accuracy_summary(): Per-source statistics
- ✅ API Endpoints:
  * /v1/predictions/surprises - Query with days, limit, min_score
  * /v1/predictions/accuracy - Per-source accuracy breakdown
- ✅ Frontend: /insights/surprises dashboard
  * Timeline comparison (predicted vs actual)
  * Color-coded surprise scores (0-1 expected, 3+ extreme)
  * Direction indicators (earlier/later)
  * Prediction source and rationale display

**Commits**:
- `a216a7d` - feat(sprint-5.2): Expand golden set to 50 examples
- `47e5d0f` - feat(sprint-5.3): Add surprise score dashboard

### ✅ Sprint 6: Data Quality & Credibility (Partial Complete)

**Sprint 6.1: Retraction Monitoring System**
- Status: **DEFERRED** - Lower priority, complex implementation
- Would require: Retraction Watch API, withdrawn paper monitoring
- Existing infrastructure: Retraction flags in database schema

**Sprint 6.2: Source Credibility Tracking**
- ✅ Scheduled daily credibility snapshot task
  * Added to celery_app.py (9 AM UTC daily)
  * Runs after all ingestion/analysis tasks
- ✅ Backend endpoints already exist:
  * /v1/admin/source-credibility - Current scores
  * /v1/admin/source-credibility/history - Time-series
- ✅ Frontend: /admin/sources dashboard
  * Grouped by tier (A/B/C/D) with descriptions
  * Shows articles, retractions, Wilson scores
  * Trend indicators for 30-day changes
- Wilson Score Methodology:
  * Conservative lower bound (95% CI)
  * Auto-tier assignment based on score and volume
  * Daily snapshots for trend tracking

**Sprint 6.3: Golden Set Expansion**
- ✅ Already completed in Sprint 5.2
- 50 examples covering all categories
- No additional work needed

**Commits**:
- `73b1c84` - feat(sprint-6.2): Add source credibility tracking

### ✅ Sprint 7: Advanced Features (Complete)

**Sprint 7.1: Live News Scraping**
- ✅ Enabled live scraping by default (scrape_real=True)
- ✅ Added 3-second rate limiting between RSS requests
- ✅ Added Adept AI blog feed
- ✅ All ingestion tasks respect robots.txt (official RSS endpoints)
- ✅ Deduplication via dedup_hash already implemented

**Sprint 7.2: Weekly Digest Generation**
- ✅ Enhanced digest task to save to JSON files
- ✅ Added digest metadata: week_start, week_end, tier_breakdown, top_events
- ✅ Created /v1/digests API endpoint (list all)
- ✅ Created /v1/digests/{date} endpoint (specific digest)
- ✅ Created /digests frontend page with card-based UI
- ✅ Color-coded surprise factors
- ✅ Shows headline, key moves, analysis, velocity assessment
- ✅ Links to featured events

**Sprint 7.3: Multi-Model Analysis**
