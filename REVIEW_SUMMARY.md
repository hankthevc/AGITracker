# Code Review Summary - AGI Tracker

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: 70-80% Complete Toward Production

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Your AGI Tracker is **well-architected and feature-rich**, but needs **cleanup and production hardening** before public launch. The code quality is good, but operational readiness has gaps.

**Full analysis**: See [CODE_REVIEW_2025.md](./CODE_REVIEW_2025.md)

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ What Works Well
- **Architecture**: Next.js + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Celery is solid
- **Evidence System**: A/B/C/D tiering properly enforced
- **Testing**: 20+ test files, good coverage foundation
- **Features**: Most of Phases 1-3 implemented
- **UI/UX**: Modern, responsive, multiple views working

### ⚠️ Critical Issues
1. **Documentation Clutter**: 80+ obsolete status/summary markdown files
2. **Migration Chain**: Broken migrations (018, 020 disabled), commented columns
3. **Deployment Confusion**: 2 Railway services, unclear which is production
4. **No Live Data**: Currently using fixtures (SCRAPE_REAL=false)
5. **No Monitoring**: Sentry configured but not verified active

### ❌ Missing for Production
- [ ] Live data ingestion enabled
- [ ] Production monitoring & alerts
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Backup/disaster recovery plan

## 🧹 Immediate Action Required

### 1. Clean Up Documentation (30 minutes)

**Problem**: 80+ files creating massive clutter

**Solution**: Run cleanup script
```bash
chmod +x cleanup_docs.sh
./cleanup_docs.sh
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: Archive obsolete documentation"
git push origin main
```

**Impact**: 
- Removes ~70 obsolete files
- Archives to docs/archive/
- Professional repository appearance

### 2. Fix Migration Chain (4-6 hours)

**Problem**: Migrations 018, 020 disabled; columns commented out

**Action**:
1. Connect to production DB and audit actual schema
2. Create migration 021 as baseline
3. Uncomment production columns in models.py
4. Delete Phase 4 placeholder code
5. Test on clean database

### 3. Consolidate Railway (2-3 hours)

**Problem**: Two services running, confusion about production

**Action**:
1. Identify canonical production service
2. Migrate data if needed
3. Delete redundant service
4. Update environment variables

### Week 3: Performance & Polish
- **Day 11-12**: Performance optimization (PgBouncer, CDN)
- **Day 13-14**: Viral features (OpenGraph images, share buttons)
- **Day 15**: Load testing

### Week 4: Launch Prep
- **Day 16-17**: UI polish (dark mode, PWA)
- **Day 18-19**: Documentation (API reference, user guides)
- **Day 20**: Final testing & launch

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Current Monthly: ~$25-100
- Railway: $20-50
- Vercel: $0-20
- OpenAI: $5-30

### Post-Production: ~$150-390
- Railway: $50-100 (higher tier)
- Vercel: $20 (Pro)
- OpenAI: $50-200 (more events)
- Monitoring: $20-50
- CDN: $10-20

**ROI**: Research impact, academic citations, policy influence, grant opportunities

---

## 🎓 Vision Alignment

### ✅ What's Aligned
- Evidence-first methodology (A/B/C/D tiers)
- Reproducible calculations (versioned scoring)
- Multiple expert roadmaps (Aschenbrenner, AI-2027, Cotra)
- Clean, modern dashboard

### ⚠️ What Needs Work
- **"Ingests AI news"**: Using fixtures, not live RSS
- **"AI-generated insights"**: Exists but not prominent
- **"Viral-ready"**: Missing social sharing, OpenGraph images
- **"Thoroughly-sourced"**: Credibility dashboard exists but hidden

**Gap**: You're 1-2 weeks away from "ingests live news" and 3-4 weeks from "viral-ready"

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

1. **Today**: Run `cleanup_docs.sh` script
2. **This Week**: Fix migration chain
3. **Next Week**: Enable live data + monitoring
4. **Week 3**: Security + performance
5. **Week 4**: Polish + launch

---

## 📊 Files to Delete/Archive

**Total**: ~80 files to clean up

### Delete Immediately (Archive First)
- `SPRINT_7_*.md` through `SPRINT_9_*.md` (keep SPRINT_10)
- `PHASE_*_COMPLETE.md` (move to docs/archive/)
- `DEPLOYMENT_*.md`, `RAILWAY_*.md`, `VERCEL_*.md` (consolidate)
- `CONTINUE_HERE.md`, `START_HERE.md` (redundant with README)
- `AGENT_*.md` (move to .cursor/prompts/)
- 40+ other status/summary files

### Consolidate
- 3 different "QUICK_START" files → 1 QUICKSTART.md
- Multiple deployment guides → 1 DEPLOYMENT.md

**Script handles all this**: Just run `./cleanup_docs.sh`

## 🎉 Conclusion

**You've built something impressive**. The core features are there, the architecture is sound, and the vision is clear. You're not starting from scratch—you're **70% done**.

**The remaining 30%** is mostly operational:
- Cleanup (documentation, migrations)
- Productionization (monitoring, security)
- Polish (performance, viral features)

**Timeline**: 4 focused weeks gets you to a production-ready, launch-worthy state.

**First Step**: Run the cleanup script today. It takes 5 minutes and immediately makes your repo more professional.

```bash
chmod +x cleanup_docs.sh
./cleanup_docs.sh
```
